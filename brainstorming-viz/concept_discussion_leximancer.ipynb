cool.it was a, you - you inflate a balloon. |||| yeah, awesome.that's pretty cool. |||| like i know, my - my brother for senior design, did a really like, it was a - it's pretty cool.i mean i'm not saying we should do this because obviously it's been done before, but it was like a spider man, like sort of like this but it was a spiderman and it had a mechanism that would like, go like this. ||||

that.i think that'd be really cool, 'cause trebuchets and stuff - could build your own castle. |||| i think it's really cool.it's so funny. |||| that'd be cool.i had someone who was gonna do that for

ones? |||| what he thinks about when he draws everything.i think that's kinda cool. |||| ratank, racecar tank's pretty cool.goes 150 miles an hour, burnouts. |||| and he sees through mirrors so he doesn't get shot in the face.oh, that's cool. |||| got my tank.that looks cool. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| yeah.that's cool. |||| let's not just think college, because we might be limiting ourselves.let's think for kids that are 12 and under also, like do something that would be cool - i don't know. |||| never mind.actually, college is very cool. |||| carrying around a small one would be kinda cool, small one that packs a punch.yeah, but how do you - sorry. |||| it'd be pretty cool to actually be able to make - \\nsay they all have like rubber band power  or something so they can actually be self-propelled.i like that. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| windup propeller, right?you know what would be cool, though? |||| everything else .that's cool. |||| it is a turbocharger.what if you had like desk toys that are not just like cool; they like do - \\nyou have another hour and ten minutes. |||| oh, okay.yeah, that would be cool, cuz i don't think those toys have been developed to their fullest state. |||| i've seen - i had one a long time ago that was transparent everything, so it was like just plastic on the sides.it was pretty cool. |||| i was like, \\\"yeah.\\\"you know what i thought was a cool thing? |||| gyros are really cool.it's a complicated motion for us to even try. |||| you know what's also cool?those like magnet balls, like you put them together and - \\noh, those are cool. |||| yeah, something magnetic is - \\na magnet would be a cool thing to play with.i'm wondering how a toddler would like that. |||| that would actually be a cool idea for this one.pretty much like the entire car would actually be modular. |||| \\\"god, i gotta dodge these objects, so i'm gonna turn right,\\\" and then if you do turn right, then your chair's actually turning right with you.that'd be kind of cool. |||| yeah.that was pretty cool. |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| that'd be kind of cool.you can always fill a kiddie pool up and do it. |||| you can just change his .you know what would be cool? |||| how about a maze in which you gotta get your boats through and you control the flow of water?that'd be pretty cool. |||| it turns into - it makes a flying thing.yeah, that'd be kinda cool. |||| wasn't that cool when you - ?i was surprised i could do that. |||| that's good.so i think if we put a circle on it would look cool, like this was kinda like . |||| i think it's pretty cool, too.it'd be cool if we could get a couple - if we have like an apple - go go gadget apple, just throw him at . |||| it'd be cool if you had like little springs in 'em so they actually like popped out when you press the button or you pull this down or something.so you're sitting there. |||| comes out with one of your teeth.i'm so happy, this is so cool. |||| like going into it from the beginning.cuz one's cool, but having two to see like the very distinct options. |||| see, that sounds pretty cool.. |||| the thing that could make this pretty cool is the  and proe cuz we could add like little motors in it or we join - we can actually see it like unfold.not run, i mean like see it you can see it starts the orange and you can actually see it like  if we do it right. |||| yeah, that could be cool.they've already done that, but thinking on something like that. |||| yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. |||| yeah, and then it would like hover off the table and you could like twist 0:31:19.0 it around.that's cool. |||| i mean, it would be cool if like you had a transformer and there was like a lever on it or something, like a switch you could pull or something and just by doing that one input, it would like change the whole thing.i feel like that would be incredibly hard to do. \",\" yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. |||| yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. \",\" let's not just think college, because we might be limiting ourselves.let's think for kids that are 12 and under also, like do something that would be cool - i don't know. |||| let's not just think college, because we might be limiting

smaller spring on one side, but the launcher works for all your different sets of frogs.you get big fat ones, you can have little skinny ones, ones with little wings on it if you want. \",\" let's do more water ones.that seems possible, right, cuz we got a lot of everyone's. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| i'm thinkin' all the easy ones have been done.a ball you can kick, a ball you can throw. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up

thing is, it's a pulse signal, i'm pretty sure, that goes through a speaker.say like we can just go buy like, those ones that are, there's ones that are like - \\na constant? |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. \",\" i had at least ten different clothes, like master ones.then i used to call my friends over, and we used to form teams and just like role-playing kind of a thing. |||| i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| yeah, there'd be either like some sort of spring hinge here or maybe you have a smaller spring on one side, but the launcher works for all your different sets of frogs.you get big fat ones, you can have little skinny ones, ones with little wings on it if you want. |||| once you got the truck, like space design done and how you're gonna connect it, whether it's just like little pushpins, i think that one would be one of the easier ones.it'd be really the coming up and designing like each of the parts: making doors, making roofs, making rams, making a shield or different colors. |||| if we do the orange, though, i really do think we should try to at least get two different ones.we could do that. |||| yeah, i can see - i don't know if you could do it differently.you could have like - i don't know - some goals like this or like different ones worth different points or something. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. \",\" well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they did it with that and they were able to actually move along the lake. |||| well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they

concepts. |||| they were these little spinny top things that like went to battle.kind of like ones with a competitive aspect. \",\" or maybe just not make  - or talk it out at least?i guess - should we take off - yeah, take off the ones that didn't get any votes. |||| well, i guess it's more kind of like a brainstorming thing.i always thought the coolest ones were the ones that connect, like there's only five but every one connects to each other. \",\" i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| yeah, let's take off the ones that got zero and one, but we also do - \\nwell, we have ten minutes to draw the - \\nyeah.yes. |||| i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| yeah, let's take off the ones that got zero and one, but we also do - \\nwell, we have ten minutes

toy that reads an audiobook for a bedtime story. |||| we're an approved study which will not affect your grades and i won't, or anybody, grade it, ever see it,  going to improve the raw quality of what we are doing.okay, so your goal today is to design a toy that exhibits a creative, non-trivial motion. |||| okay?your main goal is to brainstorm and be - a lot of what brainstorming and visually you can start from any point, brainstorming and we do a few things later to play value, and of course, because you're designing a toy you want to, caution you to keep the play value ideas in your mind when you are generating your ideas. |||| you should have had enough practice on it by now, okay?also notes to describe your final concept, and also add some notes describing your target customer, okay, it's a toy for kids, so. |||| can it just be any toy, or does it have to be like the motion?i think we just do motion on that, but you can draw anything and then try - think of adding motion. |||| well did the - \\nmake sure the .are we doing just like motion, or the whole toy and everything? |||| yeah, this is your toy.okay. |||| but the toy has to be with like, motion, right?yeah, it has to have motion. |||| we don't have much for this, but you can put it up there.it's not like a full toy but it would be a, i don't know what we'd do with it. |||| it depends what kind of toy we want to, you guys.. |||| oh, we can do a taz too, a taz toy too.we should do that, oh, just like a taz. |||| you've got like, i don't know, just start naming movies like monsters, inc., and toy story.toy story should be - \\nthe dog. |||| put a taser in it?yeah, if you like, rotate something - \\nthe taser toy? |||| it'd be a toy, yeah.our best idea will come out of that. |||| i had a toy when i was a kid, it was very simple but very cool.it was a, you - you inflate a balloon. |||| that's not a bad idea.you can interpret that into something, like, a power toy? |||| huh?how do you - \\nhow do you make the sound in the toy, or how do i make it? |||| yeah, like, the motion is - \\nalready looking forward, that's gonna be hard.'cause to make it like random - \\ndoes your toy have to be largely - 'cause he said not to worry about like, the costs or like the  yet. |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| now, is that really a toy i  or?it's a toy. |||| we could do like a - like a thing, like you hold it like this, imagine that because it's a toy, and just have like a sort of thing that you like, slide down, push down on, and that makes the arm go like this, where like you have two arms that like, i mean like this, and then that, at the same time sparks.sparks it? |||| that would be really neat.kinda like the - what is it - like from toy story, the hand that  . |||| i wonder who the first person was to think of the penach 13:19 toy.oh, yeah. |||| i thought -   \\nwhere that toy museum is?yeah, so it looks like those - they actually have something that can carve out 3d images -   \\noh, really? |||| that'd be a bathroom toy that'd just run - it'd be like a bottom of the tub skimmer, just skim around the bottom.that'd be pretty sweet. |||| make your kids do the housework.next generation of toy is tricking your children into cleaning. |||| yeah.i wonder if you could compress enough air in a little ball and then have it - i'm thinking practical joke type of toy, where you could compress enough air into a ball and then it releases, and it looks like either - it either makes a big splash underwater or it makes it look like someone farted. |||| do you think that would be approved?a shooting toy? |||| we could have something that takes - well, it'd be like more of a pool toy, like kinda - have you ever played with those paint grenades?you know, it like -   \\nlike in paintballing, or -   \\nyeah, yeah, so they have the paint grenades. |||| this is our -   \\noh, right, a motion toy.i would say the motorized cooler, but they already have that. |||| very creepy toy.that would be good. |||| what was the - do you remember what the toy was off of toy story with that's ?the hand? |||| it's a way that - like you could put springs on a segway so you could jump  upstairs.i had a toy. |||| yeah.that was kind of a challenge toy. |||| okay.it's just like that movie big where he was the best toy designer, 'cause really he was a 13-year-old kid. |||| some sort of car or something - yeah, you can sit in it and it propels you across the room - a giant wind-up toy.fission, chris 70:16.    \\nfission? |||| here's what i think.i thought it just had to be a toy that -   \\nyeah. |||| big kid toy.we get to describe our own target market - customer, so we could just say -   \\nforget kids. |||| but it's a tailgate toy.it has to be a closed can, though. |||| i mean, what's the point?it's going in my toy - or game, but it -   \\nit's true. |||| could still have a toy.yeah. |||| what's a toy you always wanted as a child?hmm. |||| let's see.what's a toy? |||| what's a toy?pirate ship. |||| this is off topic.i have not seen a girl in this class, so i'm guessin' we're gonna get a lotta of toy soldiers and boats and cars and stuff, huh? |||| it'd be like an office toy.yeah. |||| what toys could we make for an office that like - let's say engineers or - \\nstressing out and they need a toy to like - \\nexactly.what - and i don't know if this has been done, so tell me if it has. |||| the perfect beach toy .they might even have that already now. |||| what if we took that battleship idea with toy helicopters?what do you mean by that? |||| let's make them both the most annoying toy ever.what would be the most annoying toy ever? |||| well, first of all, i'm gonna - \\na pac-man toy that drives around; it goes, \\\".\\\"i don't know. |||| it would not shut up.i think that's one of the key things that makes a toy annoying. |||| there's a concept right there.the most annoying toy ever . |||| the toy that never dies.you could just imagine that freaking some little kid out. |||| is that labeled as the most annoying toy ever?i said we're annoying. |||| a wind-up toy where it could pull the cherry out and then it goes up until the cherry gets next to its mouth.nice. |||| let's see.an office toy - you think you're day's bad? |||| give me a toy.do we have a favorite ? |||| what is a fun toy?name something else. |||| name another game, a video game, a toy.you said super smash brothers. |||| we could turn that into a toy.i don't know to do - \\na fucking giraffe. |||| how about a jousting game?a jousting toy? |||| i like the most annoying toy ever.yes. |||| yeah, i do like the pac-man one.the most annoying toy ever. |||| the most annoying toy ever.just whole bunch of random things . |||| i do like the most annoying toy as well.i like the remote control shark though. |||| most annoying toy.okay, let's rate this. |||| the crazy ball hustling toy?that'd be a pain to try to work out. |||| yeah.the most annoying toy ever . |||| i don't think so.i think it's just design a toy. |||| just design the thing.design a toy. |||| i was gonna say cuz the market for pac-man might be a little small; the most annoying toy.do we wanna try and add sound with that if we do it? |||| on the first slide it says design a toy with - \\nyeah.oh, in the back of it. |||| oh yeah.you could have some sort of a helicopter toy that hovers. |||| you could have prob'ly something that can hover on water, and then it could start flying, and then also be on land.that'd be one hard toy to design. |||| you could make a fish toy that you could jump out the water with, like flying from water, outside of water like a flying fish.flying fish. |||| they could go like - \\nour toy goes fast on a train.they could go in two directions. |||| some toy like that.wind up . |||| that would be a crappy toy if you hafta - it goes on for half a second and then you gotta pick it back up.is that like a pinball machine? |||| now we can do toy ideas.what? |||| the pegs only fit in certain boxes so you hafta - \\n\\n - means you physically can't build it any other way.sounds like the opposite of toy design. |||| tryin' to think of what we could do with a car.we should go to a different toy. |||| no, i'm talking about a new toy.you'd prob'ly hafta wind it or something. |||| can a shoe be considered a toy though?you could make it. |||| can we make a shoe - \\nthat's - yeah.- that's always a toy? |||| what else can we do?let's think of a toy that's already out there, and then try to redesign. |||| take an idea and develop it, our new toy, a new piece of paper.all right. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| what about this?what should be do with the egg-drop toy? |||| their train's gonna be destroyed after the first use so - \\nit's a terrible toy.right. |||| this toy it would just - \\nit's like you play for half a minute and just - \\nyou could be like something - we could put some kinda sensor in there if it feels a certain force or if one gets knocked over.maybe when you buy it it comes in with a set of trains and attachments, and then you can attach things wherever you want. |||| that's the toy factor, right?is it exciting for a little kid to see something big and it becomes small? |||| we're not gonna be able to print.what sort of - where could we take that for a toy? |||| yeah.but how can we make it unique and a toy? |||| those little toy boats that you put a candle under.wait, let me just - \\nthere's a valve so water in it can only go one way. |||| that's not safe for a kid's toy.you have to have that hollow. |||| it's a kid's toy, right?like, any ages before like 16.  why don't we get like a neil armstrong - \\naction figure. |||| i think we should give the kids these toys in china where they're like - they work in factories and make stuff, and that's their toy.you're terrible. |||| i know.we need to focus on this toy. |||| we need to focus on the toy.you know what would be really cool, is if we took those little smarties and had like a little guy fling 'em like a frisbee, and like a little frisbee. |||| i don't think i can actually write that on a kid's toy.no. |||| i thought you were talkin' about actually like look for toy - \\nno, no, no, no.- tanks and like - okay. |||| well you don't cuz it's a toy.well, you have like a black - like a window. |||| like i don't think having a pendulum that does this is trivial.something that does something to the toy, which in turn i mean makes noise or something. |||| pick an age and then see what activities they do.i wanna toy that i would wanna play with, college student toy. |||| i think a college student toy would be pretty relatively easy.that's a good idea. |||| do we start off with like an age that we wanna do or just like any sort of ?like we just decided to do a college student toy and just go on on that. |||| don't go into too much details.shower toy or bath toys, same thing. |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| or a desk toy.dorm room, desk toy. |||| office toy.office toy, desk toy. |||| yeah.rube goldberg uses current stuff, so desk toy, office toy could again involve the launcher and the office toy could just - your coworker's desk or something. |||| we need something that's a toy, so that's fun to play with, not something that helps you do other things.has those play values. |||| play on the walk, right?toy for the walk. |||| toy for breakfast club.oh, okay. |||| it's powered somehow.we know about it, so that if something changes, this one has auto - \\nyou think making the toy just for everybody  so you'd have to put it back together? |||| like a shower caddy that's a toy as well.it has a . |||| we'll get back to that.dorm room desk toy. |||| this desk toy.i had this little truck that had an airplane on it. |||| i mean it was just a toy.at work there used to be like - actually you had diesel engine parts that were the color of the bathroom pass. |||| i think desk toy will be like most  of them, so right now we have two types of desk toys: something that launches and something that's a rocker.i think the launch thing is a desk toy, unless you guys have another idea. |||| it's all pretty much like that.something that - \\nyou know, like a large-scale - \\nyou think we can brainstorm a little bit, like what kind of toy did you like to play on the way back? |||| yeah, engaging.like a toy where everyone kinda like really be around. |||| so toy plus toy plus toy plus toy.some people wanna, \\\"so i kind of like that one, every single one, and i wanna .\\\" |||| okay.we'd be developing it as one toy as opposed to make three different toys. |||| well, just to go aside it would be better if when we're designing it if we designed the first toy first.make it modular. |||| so that's what a gyroscope is, so what kind of toy do we do that's nontrivial motion, don't just throw it?i mean that would come back into rocker kind of section, which is not a problem. |||| they're some little toy called fushigi.pretty much all it is is a completely mirrored ball, but like you can do all this stuff with it, be observer. |||| i don't think we have the compact toy, either.put it on the modular toys. |||| that's more important in the beginning.later on you can figure out - \\nso a toy that's multiple toys. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| we have another modular toy.let's not limit ourselves to cars, though. |||| for a modular toy, now we have all these car things.i didn't make this one up. |||| a toy in a toy in a toy.what if instead of a toy in a toy, it's like - i mean this is kinda how they did it where it's like toy one and then  two. |||| then you continue this process, so this would be toy two, this would be toy five, this is toy one again, three, four.what does it do? |||| i mean it wouldn't have been .well, unless we think of another modular toy we'll just go with the gyroscope. |||| keeps pointing the same way.how do we use it in a toy? |||| i don't know.that'd be a pretty crazy toy. |||| as a desk toy?it was, like you've played pinball before, right? |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| my boats.i like the bath toy. |||| i really do like the bath, but especially if we can make it maybe modular.like this itself can be modular, but even if that's the only toy that we make, i sort of think it really combines everything that we talked about, so we're really not limiting ourselves depending on where we wanted to put it, like put our focus onto that or . |||| or we can all draw a perspective.i'm just saying if we develop this idea properly, what are we doing with that bath toy? |||| the toy?no. |||| for now, like honestly just making a boat that .i mean kinda like going with the dude toy concept here with the swimmer and the boat. |||| oh, let's hear about it.so, you got like a little plastic toy frog thing, little launcher that, for a lack of better word, is gonna be stick yea wide or so. |||| so - \\nstarted using these football - it wouldn't be a little kid toy, hopefully.you got two, say, eight by eight boxes on either side of you with holes in 'em, and you're lined up so that these different holes here kind of an upward angle, and when it launches one out it'll go into the other corresponding hole. |||| thought of a very destructive toy.destructive toy? |||| don't break my toy.really, like you build it however you want so you can have like this massive tank or this really fast streamlined thing. |||| no idea's a bad idea.i just don't think that would work for a kid toy. |||| making you die.actually, is there anything we could do with that, like another toy, you don't know what's gonna happen when you activate it? |||| an adult toy.i didn't catch that. |||| yeah, well it hurts - or not.was anyone interested in like things now that we could make into a toy? |||| i don't know, things that you do at this stage of life  that we can make into a toy for someone younger 0:02:58.2.   \\nmost of the games people play our age are like sports.yeah. |||| it could be like a dog toy.it could be like a sensory toy for a child. |||| does our toy actually have to move or do we have to move 0:04:48.7 the toy?well, i mean, can we come up with some sort of like game, like an educational game maybe that requires the toy as part of it? |||| i don't really know what girls would play with.barbie, toy horses. |||| we can make an underwater wind-up toy that's a mermaid.my duck is there. |||| if we were doing a wind-up, would we rather do a water toy than a flying thing like a plane?i don't know. |||| i like the hover toy idea as well.which one was that? |||| it's just like a wind-up toy just like, kinda like the one that we - the one based off that kind of, the one where it's kind of like that.instead of like trying to throw it, it's just supposed to like hover around little surfaces. |||| instead of having like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like that and air would come  and push the ball out, so it was like an actual person going for a hoop.yeah, so the toy is like a person, it looks like a person? \",\" we're an approved study which will not affect your grades and i won't, or anybody, grade it, ever see it,  going to improve the raw quality of what we are doing.okay, so your goal today is to design a toy that exhibits a creative, non-trivial motion. |||| can it just be any toy, or does it have to be like the motion?i think we just do motion on that, but you can draw anything and then try - think of adding motion. |||| well did the - \\nmake sure the .are we doing just like motion, or the whole toy and everything? |||| but the toy has to be with like, motion, right?yeah, it has to have motion. |||| yeah, like, the motion is - \\nalready looking forward, that's gonna be hard.'cause to make it like random - \\ndoes your toy have to be largely - 'cause he said not to worry about like, the costs or like the  yet. |||| this

motion? |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and

years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| i'll write that down.i know like a, kinda like a board like this, and then you'd like, put little different stuffs? |||| they, i

|||| no, no, no, because like the way samsung, because you know, each phone, like each android, can use like a operating system in a different way.like, htc has a slightly different, like it's just

get -   \\nright. |||| yeah.if they were all different - 'cause sometimes they'd cancel. |||| sometimes they'd amplify, so if they just make it one .would it have to be four different motors, or two - your gear ratios? |||| well, they'd all be connected if they were gear ratios.if they're two different gear ratios then we guarantee they're gonna be different, or -   \\nit would be different frequencies of the spin. |||| but that's - yeah, that's not what we're concerned about.if we use different gear ratios . |||| i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| i think we do something - using the tails as rudders or something and then having it just so that we can go in different directions.i don't think that's trivial, because you could say it's always going forward, but -   \\nwell, not necessarily, though. |||| yeah.i don't know if they like - you can give the duck different sized feet, so it kinda makes it - the water catches one part or the other, and then you can get it to do circles, at least. |||| yeah, so you'd have different throwing things.you could have some of them catapults and some trebuchets, some fires a barrage of arrows or something. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and then where all the different sections of the snake are connected, with somehow - they'd all articulate so

you could do it with different mascots. |||| it's a different book.the people that i've been talking to said it was pretty good. |||| i mean, i know we actually kind of arrived on that, but is this what this - the whole thing was for?i hope so, 'cause i  i don't know - one of my teammates on senior design said that they had to do 100 different ideas - 100 different drawings. |||| instead of a little top, you just had a ball and you were trying to kick it.although they might've already done that on a long scale, so i'm trying to think of how to make it different. |||| i like that idea we had up at top that kind of flies different directions somehow.yes. |||| i don't know how to do it.like bumps at certain points so when it spins down, it flies in different directions or - but just something that spins around and - \\nor a weight - like a weight on the inside that could shift somehow. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| something like that.like it was a set that came with, i don't know, different kinds of walls or a cannon or a couple cannons and sand bags, just all sorts of different army things. |||| and you have a tiny camera.maybe these are different in the dark. |||| like you wake up in the morning and it's different.oh. |||| that almost gets into a - \\nor this is - \\noh, you could almost do like a angry birds kinda thing where you set up a structure trying stop from getting knocked over and then you have a cannon that fires different kinds and do different things.yeah. |||| yeah.there was a one where it had like - it was like a handle with all this different stuff coming off of it. |||| it had five options.you could do a mechanical bop it type thing, as to where you have different levers rip 48:38 it and kinda start moving out or untwisting or whatever and one of 'em finally reaches all the way out position, you know, explodes or something. |||| what's the one they have a big pile of different pins and you have to put them all in?i don't - i've never seen that. |||| adult toys.which makes it sound a lot worse and different. |||| that'd completely change the game.oh, but no, it would because you could put 'em in at different locations. |||| well, and you - it's almost - it almost becomes a robotics project.it'd need to move in different way when the lights are out. |||| rolling yeah.well, rolling is a different - \\nit's a different - \\ndifferent. |||| yeah.different axes. |||| i've built one before.what can you make that's different? |||| tryin' to think of what we could do with a car.we should go to a different toy. |||| yeah.i mean, you can always have a different design. |||| i was just saying it different.right. |||| what can we do to make them different?that's why - \\ni think a camera would - something with a camera would be really cool. |||| his desk 30:04.  we may need to stop and go in a completely different direction.what else can we - marble run with oreos. |||| so why don't we have marshmallows - \\ncould be, yeah.- inject like different flavors? |||| then you have like a syringe.you can inject it with like a different flavor. |||| just be two different loaders, right?sure. |||| well, at least we'll remember this for the different multiple ways to - \\ni see.like we could put a little ring at the end of the pull string. |||| okay.we'd be developing it as one toy as opposed to make three different toys. |||| well, i mean we would make three parts and then  together and then when we make them we could make  and then  in all different ways.yeah. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| not only does that house all your army guys, but it also turns into different things.is that what you're saying? |||| they're just different colors, and this guy starts his one ship or two ships and five soldiers or something, and the other guy starts with them, too.it seems more prone to success as a videogame than mechanical. |||| actually, i thought of something.instead of using two different fluids, we could use two fluids and a solid, cuz then those definitely will not mix. |||| cuz this is where you add - i thought you were actually a different signer i thought you were a different signer, actually.what if we have like a little diver dude. |||| yeah, there'd be either like some sort of spring hinge here or maybe you have a smaller spring on one side, but the launcher works for all your different sets of frogs.you get big fat ones, you can have little skinny ones, ones with little wings on it if you want. |||| but you have some sort of like launching mechanism.you load your different frogs in and kangaroos if we wanted to do your little - all into the same launcher and they'd let 'em go and like poom!, take off. |||| different fruits?yeah, cuz you can have it be from like bananas. |||| so - \\nstarted using these football - it wouldn't be a little kid toy, hopefully.you got two, say, eight by eight boxes on either side of you with holes in 'em, and you're lined up so that these different holes here kind of an upward angle, and when it launches one out it'll go into the other corresponding hole. |||| now, what your job is - this is a game you play with a couple other people, so player one, you sit there facing side one, side one, and it's gonna require all of these at different times, and your job is to knock 'em down out of the air.it'll all go over and you see how many you can knock down. |||| there's a few different things you can get at that.we should call it goalie training. |||| or, sorry, hovers.it can hover at different heights and - \\nis it on like a remote control? |||| i think you can build a lot off it in terms of different toys.i'm trying to think of how difficult that would be to actually make. |||| each trigger will pop up shooting a single like flap as a goalie.over here you've got different shooters that have - so you're gonna have the mound, they go, they fall, and if they don't score they kinda come in this track and they come back around, just like gravity, they're rolling back around. |||| then you can have like a bunch of different slots where they could shoot from so they don't know which one it's coming from.have like ten slots or something. |||| once you got the truck, like space design done and how you're gonna connect it, whether it's just like little pushpins, i think that one would be one of the easier ones.it'd be really the coming up and designing like each of the parts: making doors, making roofs, making rams, making a shield or different colors. |||| if we do the orange, though, i really do think we should try to at least get two different ones.we could do that. |||| i don't think we need to match particularly well, just as long as we have an idea.in fact, i bet if we got a couple different ideas of how we wanted to do this. |||| we'll have to look in the different languages in how they pronounce their different fruit.i don't know. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| yeah.we could like put like a propeller at the front where we could have it like on the wings or something different, to customize your own. |||| i was trying to think of different ways you can do that.have you ever seen that game, it's kinda like foosball but you have marbles that like shoot and there's like a - so like here you have marbles and they go down and they just shoot across and then there's like a little trap here. |||| then all the marbles would come back here and come out for that player to use.then like at the top, there would be a bunch of different holes right there, so you'd be able to choose. |||| i was thinking of life sized rock 'em and sock 'em robots where like if you wear 0:26:33.3 just like it shoots with different parts on it and then if the other person punches you and a part of the suit, it like falls off, so when your suit's gone, you lose or something like that.or like something where they punch you somewhere in the - don't their heads shoot up if they - \\nyeah. |||| have different heights 0:32:17.3.  \\nwe, well, yeah.okay, gonna get go, i said, let's just make a rifle for children. |||| yeah, i can see - i don't know if you could do it differently.you could have like - i don't know - some goals like this or like different ones worth different points or something. |||| we could do - it would be like air hockey with a ball and then have the board set up so it's got like different mechanisms in it.if you could hit it into like a track, then it would like roll the ball back to be catapulted and then you could like shoot it - \\nso like a pinball table? |||| there are all those transformers and all those sort of toys.i don't know how we could change that though to make it something different. |||| .so wind-up - \\nlike make it different somehow if we add some more stuff to it maybe. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. ||||

go  \\nyeah. |||| they don't really  motions.i mean, they're not got little motors and stuff you could add to it? |||| oh yeah.i'm just sayin' stuff. |||| a kit with rubber bands and stuff.and straws.

around and ate stuff.candy. |||| do we make it flat or do we make it like super high up?that, you have more room to do stuff in; this, not so much. |||| just the insides, like motors and stuff.i was thinking the same thing. |||| i like that.what kind of stuff were you interested in? |||| and what's the definition of nontrivial motion?nontrivial is i mean nothing - launching is kind of a trivial thing, but, nontrivial motion is - you've done  and stuff like that. |||| yeah.rube goldberg uses current stuff, so desk toy, office toy could again involve the launcher and the office toy could just - your coworker's desk or something. |||| the funny thing is like i notice when you become a college student you pretty much like to play with some of these other toys that are meant for kids.legos and stuff? |||| how do you design a gun that's never been done before?there could be other stuff on it. |||| aside from - \\nlaunches stuff.maybe you have to auto-correct, something. |||| if you could put all this stuff in, like set it up before you turn the water on in your bath, and as the water comes up they all go to battle.like during the fill-up part of the bath all these things are going around and like find each other. |||| yeah, add more ages, so we'll work on that one or just make a new one?i would play with that if i was 22. \\njust gonna add more stuff in here, then. |||| they're some little toy called fushigi.pretty much all it is is a completely mirrored ball, but like you can do all this stuff with it, be observer. |||| just add more stuff.are we going to actuate the thing,

outer ball doesn't weigh that much then pretty much the motion is controlled by the thing that's inside, right? |||| it's just gonna come down slowly.you need some forward motion. |||| yeah.then you have the forward motion. |||| or is that just showing the motion?you want me to start - you mean this? |||| no, i'm not kidding.what mechanical motion are we gonna have? |||| you can't just put a fan on it and have that be all - \\nno, that's the rudders, the mechanical motion.that is kinda cool, actually. |||| anyways - \\ncandle pellet hot air balloon.what mechanical, non-trivial motion can we add to it? |||| - is, from what i've seen, it's been motion isn't very predictable.it's a fish. |||| like program it to have like random motion?. |||| it would be hard to get it to go in the right - cuz my point about the fish was that it's kinda hard to actually get some propulsion.but if we could figure - maybe the fin will actually move just for mechanic motion, but we put a fan on an underneath - or this is a hard line and so it actually looks like the fish is pulling it, but really the boat is driving it. |||| what about a crocodile line with the steve irwin thing?with the same mechanical motion of the fish? |||| i think we should have a bunch of alligators inside the boat and then - \\nyou know what we could do is have some sort of a - the croc, alligator, could be purely mechanical, no electrical thing in it, and this line could be like something hollow or something to where it just had a shaft or just really a cable in there pulling, and then like tensioning and then loosening, tensioning and loosening.they could just pull a lever to make some sort of mechanical motion like the fish in an alligator or a crocodile, whatever. |||| it's twisting.it's a - \\noh, the motion. |||| and what's the definition of nontrivial motion?nontrivial is i mean nothing - launching is kind of a trivial thing, but, nontrivial motion is - you've done  and stuff like that. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| a frisbee is trivial motion.something else to do. |||| there's actually one

so that's what a gyroscope is, so what kind of toy do we do that's nontrivial motion, don't just throw it?i mean that would come back into rocker kind of section, which is not a problem. |||| just a suggestion: don't get stuck up in trivialities with the nontrivial motion.you can relax it, bring it back later, so just come up with more creative ideas. |||| you just simple - geez - so non-trivial motion.i'm trying to think of non-trivial motion. |||| don't get stuck up in realities, the non-trivial motion.you can relax it, bring it back later, so just come up with more creative ideas. |||| i

anything? |||| there ya go.got it, blake 23:41.  i was thinking what about something like a maze board that you can remote control, and then you'd get to shift it? |||| oh yeah.or you could control the top. |||| looks like a buckyball.do you control both axes? |||| would you control it yourself, or would it do it by itself?yeah. |||| or control it.cuz what about getting back? |||| no.you control this. |||| you control the tops with that?they spin on that axis. |||| exactly.how would you control it? |||| what?how would you control it? |||| you hafta make everything remote control.you wanna just go back to all these ideas, and then just add more things to it or think of it more? |||| if it lands over here these ones come out.would that be tough to control? |||| i mean, that still when you add like one door or dimension you could bend this way, this way, this way and \\nyeah, that's true.that'd prob'ly make it more difficult to control. |||| too hard to control.i don't know how it'd work. |||| it's a ball that can roll around everywhere.oh, you control it. |||| you control it and then - \\nhow do you control the where it goes?where it rolls - \\n\\n - around? |||| yeah.i just don't know how you could control. |||| i don't know how it would be controlled.ball with remote control. |||| even if it's big and becomes smaller?well - \\nhow do we control that? |||| you think that'd be enough?the good part about this is that you could probably control exactly how it's rolling once it reached that speed versus the bounce where it's hard to control how it lands. |||| what's goin' on?a remote control? |||| could make it - \\ni feel like there's too much control for this class required.you know what i'm sayin'? |||| so this is - oh, this is actually - there's too much control there.well, you know what? |||| frequency and - \\nthings of control, so like forward and backward would be one channel cuz it's on the one stick, and left and right would be one channel.maybe the wheels turn with the rudder or the fan. |||| why on earth would i wanna shift with my left hand?because you want the control on the steering wheel with your right hand. |||| cuz you want control with your left hand.just - okay. |||| the only reason you're doing - you're driving on the left hand is cuz you were colonized by - \\nyour left hand goes forward, back, left, like left and right.your steering wheel has to like stop you crashing so you want control with that one. |||| i wouldn't have enough control.i'm like what? |||| male 1 shooting pez.what sort of control could we add to it? |||| i think - \\ncould you actually see what you're - \\nthey already make remote control submarines.they already - \\nyou have to see in the water. |||| would this be something that we control or

control it behind the thing. |||| like this thing is like hitting some rails and you can like control how high it is by squeezing this thing and it shoots air out and it goes up.you have like another

gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| i was just thinking a car has multiple parts.i don't - \\ncar problems? |||| i don't know what you would do, but - \\nwhat are you thinking now?it's a car that splits and then you use it for some other reason, though. |||| i don't know what it would do or whatever.what i was thinking of is more like if suppose it was like the navy ship in that one; it splits. |||| yeah, i'm just thinking of it.i'm just wondering how it works. |||| yeah, something super light, or if you make your own paper boat or something like that and the maze is there.so i'm thinking if this is a maze maybe with oil,  but you get in - actually, i don't see how the boat would go in the water on its own unless the piece is the width of the maze, and then you just - i see now. |||| actually, thinking about mazes in water - \\nwhat was your - ?that was just more like a bike tire thing, a bike tire. |||| and then like make the two - \\nwell, i was thinking like 3-d. \\nwell, yeah, that's the way to do it.if it's this way, then just add another board to it. |||| or do you wanna make it two wheels.so you could put like a recessed wheel - i was thinking for now you could ignore it. |||| i was thinking we could actually do - i don't know.i don't even feel like changing this box now. |||| i was thinking about maybe just like .i might be able to make a hinge right here. |||| do - actually thinking about, like how can it be like a transformer thing?yeah, yeah, but it transforms from orange. |||| yeah, that could be cool.they've already done that, but thinking on something like that. |||| i was thinking if you had - you could like make it so you can angle the guns so your shot isn't like straight on.that's just a minor change. |||| yeah, that would be the problem.i was thinking - yeah. |||| yeah, i was thinking more like you know the wind-up car, you used to just be able to pull it back and the thing would spin?so you just pull it back and let go of it? |||| okay.i was thinking of like some sort of board game, kind of like be an interactive board game thing. |||| how about like a - keep thinking about that.kind of like a handheld, pressurized water rocket or something like that. |||| i was thinking of life sized rock 'em and sock 'em robots where like if you wear 0:26:33.3 just like it shoots with different parts on it and then if the other person punches you and a part of the suit, it like falls off, so when your suit's gone, you lose or something like that.or like something where they punch you somewhere in the - don't their heads shoot up if they - \\nyeah. |||| i was thinking about how somehow like you could be playing like the fast paced game where once the sand runs out, the board explodes or something, like all the pieces like fly off the board.like a hot potato type of thing. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| that's a pretty good looking duck.i was just thinking we could do this idea before, but have like teams, so this person's trying to attack this one. \",\" last night, i was

when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| that's what i was doing for the turtle, the air - the water intake would be the mouth, and then it would just shoot out its bottom.just like nature. |||| yeah.i don't know if they like - you can give the duck different

it's just like a little - it's like a one-side rotation, so maybe if we did something like that with water, like in a pool or something, so you had air on the inside and it was pressurized and then you had - i say it was a circle, like a disc or something, and then you just had an outlet on one side at the radius - the extreme radius, and it just spins, and maybe we can get it to fly somehow?like those fireworks that spin and take off? |||| - its power than compressed water, but - that's pressurized.that's doable. |||| just need a big enough pump.or one of those - maybe kinda similar to one of those water rockets you have. |||| i never had water rocket.i never did, either, but i know like - so they -   \\noh, i had one of those. |||| - they just have water in them and -

side of the boat and - \\nthat's the pollution that got dumped in the water.yeah, it's all gasoline powered. |||| cuz it's at water level cuz they're monkeys.tyler thinks they're gonna sink. |||| i really need some water.aha! |||| as long as it moves on water, that'd be cool.water could be kind of hazardous. |||| doesn't have to be with these - \\nno, i know that, but the weight would lift or push down the boat unless there's enough buoyancy force.here's the water and this thing is floating and put the monkey inside. |||| army men or like navy men, so it's like all water-based and you have like little boats and these dudes on the boats go around and like you can have submarines.i don't know how you'd do it, but i think you could do it. |||| i don't remember anymore, but i remember - \\nhe's got a scuba doll.he can make that little thing like swim in the water and it's awesome. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| if you could put all this stuff in, like set it up before you turn the water on in your bath, and as the water comes up they all go to battle.like during the fill-up part of the bath all these things are going around and like find each other. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| you can still have like that - \\nit's a giant pool of water.kiddie pool. |||| they have a grid and like a map, so like it's red players here and if he pushes this button it shoots like a - something up.like you push it and it's spring-loaded and it just jacks this thing up and takes that thing out of the water. |||| this button and this thing goes up, takes that .water not included. |||| how about a maze in which you gotta get your boats through and you control the flow of water?that'd be pretty cool. |||| or if there's just water everywhere and you blow on it.like a sailboat? |||| yeah, something super light, or if you make your own paper boat or something like that and the maze is there.so i'm thinking if this is a maze maybe with oil,  but you get in - actually, i don't see how the boat would go in the water on its own unless the piece is the width of the maze, and then you just - i see now. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just immersed in water and you blow on it, it goes. |||| actually, thinking about mazes in water - \\nwhat was your - ?that was just more like a bike tire thing, a bike tire. |||| a maze?i don't know how, but i mean maybe a maze with something sensing the transition between water and oil or something. |||| the thing is it would work in two, because water and oil don't mix, but if you use two polar liquids, they're gonna mix with each other.what's the deal? |||| if you put water on the bottom and oil on top and you put water again, what will happen to it?the water and oil would go above the water. |||| yeah.actually, if you wanted to make it - \\nyou could have alcohol mixed with water. |||| that's like a rotational - like if the body's rotating and then it comes - and then this is where all the mass is, so like we could put like something that's aerodynamic here so there's more drag up here, more mass down there so his body extends so that he goes into the water with the heavy side down, you know what i mean?yeah. |||| well, i mean you figure it's like cemented over here, so when the boat's on land it'll just be like this little wheel over here inside the boat.this is the boat, and then when we wanna put down, this thing connects down, say here, whatever, water flows that way. |||| i got a jump and go rocket, kinda goin' off the water rocket idea.so it's make a pump? |||| you fill it full of water, some air in there, you got your hose.when you jump on it all the air that's currently in your little bladder would fly up into the rocket. |||| you've got a large compression in there, large compression water shoots out.pshooo! |||| it's just like water coming out.it's just like acid that comes out. |||| okay, so we could do the water balloons or chalk-tipped balloons..  those are just minor modifications again to the same things 0:09:34.2.  \\nyeah, i'm still leaning more towards the wind-up cars.wind up car, that's a good - \\nwe can do like an animal of some kind. |||| yeah, yeah.fire water balloons, like a catapult that fires water balloons. |||| how about like a - keep thinking about that.kind of like a handheld, pressurized water rocket or something like that. |||| inside the water or some liquid and give you the squeeze thing and on the other end, here's a ball and - \\nso it's like basketball?something like that, but it's not as heavy as a basketball. |||| it's this, and it shoots it into there?yeah, squeeze it, it shoots on the water, the water  same length . |||| i like the wind-up ideas.i like my wind-up water duck. |||| if we were doing a wind-up, would we rather do a water toy than a flying thing like a plane?i don't know. |||| i think i feel that it would probably be a plane in there somewhere, someone could fly already or is that like the two  water duck.if we did like the basketball, like that bit could be on some adjustable distance thing so you can move it back and forth to make it more difficult or easier. \",\" you could do the spinning toss where you battle, but you battle on water.i guess. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just

wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they did it with that and they were able to actually move along the lake. |||| 'cause it was really weird, 'cause you'd think it would never work, but it's because there's actually other forces happening that people usually don't think about.'cause you have the backwards force of the fan pushing against the forward thrust of the sail. |||| oh, now we're .depending on what you'd wanna work out of, i'm sure it's the spring. |||| - they just have water in them and - oh, didn't we have a -   \\nthose work very well.- fluids problem like that? |||| those work very well.did you take fluids in the spring? |||| it had water on the inside and then it took off, and you had mass release and then you had thrust -   \\noh, yeah.those'll work very well. |||| that's so much work.oh, yeah. |||| that's definitely a lot of work.that's not something the 3d printer could just do or  at it. |||| just like a two-liter bottle.how does your snake work? |||| what if we had something that would be a cross - that didn't require batteries.what if it was all like - you could store mechanical work somehow, just with springs? |||| here's my two-point perspective hand crawler.good work. |||| is it hard or is it a lot of work?well, the projects are a lot of work - not as much as 352, but then the - but the exams are worse, so . |||| that was the final concept for how it would work.this is more of - how it's gonna looked. |||| what if - oh, the one pac-man could be, but what if we actually had instead of a digital one, a real live one, where you had - i don't know how that'd work.the best i can think of is if you had a bowl that lights up and this little pac-man that you could control. |||| well, it's something my company did at work, but then it got killed before it ever made it to actual production, so i think it'd still be illegal and copying it, wouldn't it?i mean, if you - if you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement, yeah, probably . |||| who do you work for?i'm not working right now, but my design firm up in cleveland, but it was a small pumpkin with a projector at the back, and there's shown a light through to - put it through another pumpkin - a full-size pumpkin, and it'd show the pumpkin face on it, so in the dark, just the light and then every once and awhile, it turns into an evil pumpkin face, so the eyes change and it grins  teeth in the mouth and, \\\"rah, rah, rah,

|||| i'm not sure that would work if it's coming out 01:26:04 the front though.why not? |||| so - i'm just trying to think of something that wouldn't be - \\ni mean, like the sloth would be a little more difficult 01:29:35.  i think if we did get to it, it would be - it's hard to judge based on difficulty.it could be something super simple to work well or you could get something more difficult to work - \\nif you wanna be 100 percent honest, we're just - we can basically narrow our thing down and say that we want something that moves forward, makes - does some kinda motion. |||| i think it's more.i might recount just to be - \\nare we gonna an off button that doesn't work? |||| that might work.if you have a building you just throw it off the building from  ledge and - \\n\\n - it becomes something and it glides down. |||| you couldn't guarantee it would work if you don't drop it high enough.yeah. |||| on it's way - but that wouldn't work.on it's way does it shoot out the wings? |||| i could see how that wouldn't work out with all the - \\ni mean, be in a bathtub - \\nonce it tips over then it's done.you know what i mean? |||| too hard to control.i don't know how it'd work. |||| yeah.which will work if you make 'em throw it upwards - \\nyeah. |||| then once its wings comes out it flies.that would work better. |||| what if we each try to develop this idea and see how it would

from the gun idea cuz it's not gonna work.we have unlimited budget. |||| there's a valve, let's say like right here, so it only allows in, nothing out.if you put a little - they work on tea lights, a

it - \\nso i'm gonna try to do an iteration of this that i think would work.the other problem - the other challenge, not problem, with the something air pushing something up, has to be relatively light, so - \\nplastic is light. |||| is - i don't know if an air coil - \\nf22 raptor.- would actually work at a low velocity. |||| would this be something that we control or just something you set

have 15 minutes to draw something, so let's just - \\nplastic.i mean, you don't need to worry about that right now. |||| then inside of it there are - \\ndraw really lightly \\nwe'll start with the

the - make it a little higher.what do you mean? |||| draw this.one of these is   bonds then, right? |||| i think you should draw - \\ni just drew \\noh well, draw how it works, so we have step one at

- because making it look accurate, we're not worried about our limitations right now.you didn't draw - you . |||| where's the force?draw it, free body diagram. |||| so you draw a dog, then try to have those kind of shape in the back, too, so it will be like this.dogfish? |||| so there was nothing else the first - \\nit's really hard to draw an arrow with these stupid squares.it looks like a delta

could do to entice them to go to bed.like a story time. |||| you'd have a slower motion.you'd have to time it when the person hits, when the ball comes in, and then it just goes back like this, like that. |||| we got time.. |||| okay.your time is almost up, so whatever final concept you sketched, please explicitly write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay? |||| make sure it's all visible, it's all .you continue to  and develop your ideas and we'll give you some time, check marks like you know, you're - we're going to go until about 10:10, okay? |||| awesome.i used to watch it all the time when i was like eight, maybe. |||| i was thinking like, one of the ideas i had was like a, looked like a swing that you like, like push, every time it goes you have to push, and then like the  you have to loop it by pushing buttons.i don't get it, what do you mean, loop it? |||| like, it's like every time you push, it like pushes the swing, like there's a mechanism that pushes the swing.yeah. |||| so like, then you have to push at the right time, and you have to kind of add on to the motion, until it like, spins.oh. |||| i'm just saying senior design, you get the whole , the whole time.you work, senior design you work on 24/7. |||| it's like the - always like in my head, every time he started erasing the board i just like, thought about like that once, and i was like,  \\\"la la la la la la la la la.\\\"oh. |||| runs around.if you don't wake up like in a certain amount of time, it just runs off. |||| we could do like a - like a thing, like you hold it like this, imagine that because it's a toy, and just have like a sort of thing that you like, slide down, push down on, and that makes the arm go like this, where like you have two arms that like, i mean like this, and then that, at the same time sparks.sparks it? |||| yeah, because if you wanna make this rotate, like - \\nyou make it punch like every time you push down, it goes like this.or like this. |||| we should just have this motion, the same time the hair could light up?with one shaft here. |||| on the inside.oh, on the other side, or maybe - \\nyou gotta make the arms - \\nit moves like this, choo-choo-choo-choo, and every time the arm goes like this, it - \\nfires the led? |||| yeah, i've never done complex modeling like that, so i have no idea.i worked on cad for a long time, so, just not, not on pro-e, but i'm trying to get used to it. |||| well, basically the idea is move the arms, light up the hair.if we have time we'll integrate the alarm clock. |||| yeah, if we time manage to make the arms move and the head light quickly, we can try the others.yeah. |||| i mean i like, i like the alarm clock, just i don't know how much time we all have.the modeling is the only difficult part is the hair and the muscle. |||| one piece of candy at a time?oh, no. |||| see, what - it's gotta be easy.you gotta be able to - how we hold the beer and do it at

that allows water in, so you have to continuously hit for a little while and it just kinda sinks it. |||| yeah.oh, so open up a little bit at a time. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one

battle forts.say that one more time. |||| at what time do we stop doing this and start working on the final?in ten. |||| yeah, elephants are the only animal that can't jump, so it kinda tries to jump a little bit .it makes a noise - elephant noise every time it tries. |||| what about something like a roulette wheel where - something has to get this box.you're here and you press a button and this spins and it stops at a certain time  around the box and that's how many drinks you have to take? |||| you have to press it at the right time, otherwise you fall off.yeah. |||| back lines didn't line up.okay, your time is almost up, so your final concept is you sketched specifically write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept. |||| little finger skateboards.wow, that's a long time ago. |||| yeah.that was a long time ago. |||| like a one-time bounce.a one-time bounce. |||| at the same time?something like that. |||| if you have a top it's more challenging cuz you have a time limit.wouldn't it tip over? |||| every time you wanna do that you gotta use a co2 canister.yeah. |||| wind a spring or something cuz then you could redo it every time instead of trying to get new canisters every time.yeah. |||| yeah.all the time. |||| we have a long time to go.we just hafta draw these. |||| what was this?maybe they both wind at the same time, the springs. |||| that way it's just user-friendly and you don't hafta worry about which way to place it every time.you just put it wherever, and then it'll just shoot off anywhere. |||| right.i don't think it would restrict it at all cuz it's only gonna be on the ground for a fraction of time. |||| cuz if you throw it from here and you spin it and throw it down, it's obviously not gonna land in that one spot every time no matter how much of a weight you put in.yeah. |||| give it time to adjust then - \\nyeah.yeah. |||| then your train's done after the first time you use it.yeah. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| like in triangles.oh  \\nevery time it hit it was actually bouncing. |||| we have market value cuz they'd always hafta buy a new

us it's like, \\\"oh my god, it's transforming\\\", but a little kid it's like - \\nyou'd extend their spin time forever.well i mean, you hafta determine who our audience is exactly. |||| cuz i mean i - \\nif you do it again it's like - \\nwhen i used to play with tops a long time ago i would get tired really quick, like five minutes i'd be, \\\"oh, this is dumb.\\\"all right. |||| if it's something that's very delicate where that shock, once it hits the ground it basically falls off, breaks off, hopeless.wait, could you guarantee that would happen every time? |||| then as you're wrapping it around you're winding the spring at the same time.i don't know. |||| then as you're wrapping it inside you're winding the spring at the same time.you know what i mean? |||| it still \\nthe problem with that is it'd hafta be - the ball would hafta hit it at that one spot every time you throw it.you know what i mean? |||| i think if you put time and effort on this it could work.definitely cool. |||| your time is almost up.whatever final concept you sketched you explicitly write the words final concept on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay? |||| i'm not going to.i won't waste my time with that. |||| which means - \\nmost of the time i hold the steering wheel with my left hand, anyways.well, that's dumb. |||| people die on alcohol all the time.and do you know how many

know why i was hurrying you guys. |||| i've seen - i had one a long time ago that was transparent everything, so it was like just plastic on the sides.it was pretty cool. |||| it's something to expand on.shouldn't spend too much time on it. |||| what is the end time, by the way?i think we have time. |||| we have a little time.ten minutes. |||| he's having a good time.he's holding up a sign that says it's him. |||| your time is almost up, so whatever final concepts you sketched, specifically write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay?you can

be . |||| and you like - \\nflies off and hits your friends and everybody has a good time.so everybody will be like we'll probably break, plays with the top - \\nsure, sure. |||| so you kinda go back and forth running around, jumping and trying to knock these down.you could easy mode where it's just kinda like one at a time and pretty slow or you can do it faster by having it launch more at a faster pace. |||| maybe 'em be - i would probably wanna do it on a much bigger, like almost table-size, and so you've got - cuz you need to have at least enough reaction time so that you see it fire

could have like four cars go at the same time.we can do four cars. |||| you load it and it just starts bouncing and every time it bounces again.it doesn't like tip over cuz it's all weighted at the bottom. |||| by the time they catch it it's like it's like a mean monster.that shoot 'em in the face with pepper spray? |||| i can imagine like getting a track system so that the balls come around and they load up in your  hard doing it below the playing field.it'd be easy to just put some kind of little electronic sensor in there that well, one, you'd have like a countdown with a little buzzer and, two, would have like just a little switch so every time a ball passed the goal and dropped down it would count it. |||| or we could have like one a humanoid and one like a four-legged one so

you try to throw them. |||| should we start writing things?yeah. |||| dragon head that just throws something.what are those things called, those boxes which just pop open? |||| throws things at you.old nerf balls. |||| i mean we could do lots of things with that one.we could have it in be an army officer or something. |||| in fact, we could have him in two armies.we could do a lot of things with that one. |||| okay?your main goal is to brainstorm and be - a lot of what brainstorming and visually you can start from any point, brainstorming and we do a few things later to play value, and of course, because you're designing a toy you want to, caution you to keep the play value ideas in your mind when you are generating your ideas. |||| from whenever we start you're going to 10:10, we start winding down at 10:10 so we collect everything, and so you can figure out when you want to start bounce selecting ideas that your team likes, and what we want when we finish at 10:10 is that we want to have a final concept which is developed in reasonable detail, and i'll explain to you what reasonable detail means.you're pretty much practice a lot of  and so on, so what we mean by detail is  those kinds of things, just for your final concept, okay? |||| also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on.okay, what else? |||| so, you would build like a little world, and you had like, a stairmaster kind of things, and then like balloons, scissors.so like, you would like, put everything together so like the guy would, like one thing would led to the other. |||| it's like just two times his room, just all full of legos, they're like all weird things.what else to do with motion? |||| in spain, there's a tv show that they do that, like, maybe the size of this room and they like, put - they make it like, go through a water tank and then the bubbles move the next part, or things like that.oh, yeah. |||| something similar.what if, what about things in the air? |||| let's do the balloonist.yeah, like, different things - \\nlike what ways can you get the motion? |||| 'cause the other thing was like the stop things here, like, it's kinda neat.i just, i just think you need something like gears and stuff, that's what you . |||| it's like wind's reflecting off, and if someone goes around the sail, it's - all kinds of weird things happen.it's like the magnet on the front of the car. |||| i don't know.children - well, they make those things like you open it, and it's a spring - a slinky thing, and so -   \\nyeah, yeah, yeah, one of those - the snake thing. |||| yeah, so you'd have different throwing things.you could have some of them catapults and some trebuchets, some fires a barrage of arrows or something. |||| this could be a cup holder, and it crawls.but use it when you're eating dinner to pass things to other people across the table. |||| that's like phase two part of it.it could do - if we go tailgate, for tailgate, we could make it do more things. |||| we're all adults here 05:05.\\ngentlemen, it is time to think.yes, first things first. |||| first things first.let's eat this candy. |||| you know what i'm saying, where like you have little levers that are attached to it and you push 'em down.like something specific to other things 06:46 somehow. |||| i mean, it's - \\nyou know what i like?you could tell my creative juices aren't flowing; i'm just remembering things. |||| what if you have something that has a little base with a spring coil in it or something and just this little lever, and then a little helicopter top that contains - and i don't know what it would contain, but contains something so when you hit this lever, it's already wound up and it just kinda releases the spring and it just flies up and goes someplace.i think there have been similar things to that. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| yeah.i love those things. |||| also, don't forget all the things we talk about, like play value and so on, right?is this the time when we're talking about nontrivial motion and stuff with that or a rotor? |||| something like that.like it was a set that came with, i don't know, different kinds of walls or a cannon or a couple cannons and sand bags, just all sorts of different army things. |||| it would not shut up.i think that's one of the key things that makes a toy annoying. |||| that almost gets into a - \\nor this is - \\noh, you could almost do like a angry birds kinda thing where you set up a structure trying stop from getting knocked over and then you have a cannon that fires different kinds and do different things.yeah. |||| yeah.what if you had a light sensor on a shield or something - \\nor a jedi or - \\nget those motorcycle things that they were riding in the woods. |||| the most annoying toy ever.just whole bunch of random things . |||| that's a little  cad will not kill this or the manufacturing.although with rapid prototype, the manufacturing for these things isn't all that bad . |||| if things get really hairy as they supposed to, we can - we won't be dealing with a lotta shit.yeah, but at the same level, like - \\nnumber three will have more room for moving parts though as well. |||| remember tech decks?oh, like the finger things. |||| you have another hour and 10 minutes.also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, right? |||| just rams off those things?yeah. |||| we could - \\nmake things strange.yeah. |||| you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try to jump over things. |||| it's like just adding things to a shoe.you just added some feature. |||| there's prob'ly a lotta these things that - \\nsprings would be pretty cool.then it'd be like a trampoline-type thing you just keep bouncing on it. |||| i know it doesn't make me think of anything else.things that are stable that are just transforming, i mean, those kinda things are already out. |||| you hafta make everything remote control.you wanna just go back to all these ideas, and then just add more things to it or think of it more? |||| people know these crazy things where if the train hits one of the spikes and smack it or something.right. |||| our things were indestructible\\nwow.what'd you make it out of? |||| this toy it would just - \\nit's like you play for half a minute and just - \\nyou could be like something - we could put some kinda sensor in there if it feels a certain force or if one gets knocked over.maybe when you buy it it comes in with a set of trains and attachments, and then you can attach things wherever you want. |||| anything else?car with swings and things. |||| anyway, what do ya think?or just action figures \\nyou would - \\nyou would stick your finger in and then shoot things? |||| you could pick things up - \\noh.- as it's flying. |||| oh, you have things spinning inside of it, right?i think. |||| i mean, i like a lotta those things actually.yeah. |||| i don't know.i mean, there could be things that could be done with it. |||| what do you call those things?one of those. |||| i thought we were doin' the frisbee.what kind of things do you like playin' with? |||| yeah.i don't know what channels are, other than things you watch. |||| frequency and - \\nthings of control, so like forward and backward would be one channel cuz it's on the one stick, and left and right would be one channel.maybe the wheels turn with the rudder or the fan. |||| you throw a lot of things out there and not a lot of 'em are any good.hey, the more the better. |||| well, i guess it would, but if you had just like a servo, really, to just go do do do, and the tail would be up.then we could have it coupled with some of the other things on there, too. |||| we need to have like certain weight - \\nwe can always - i don't wanna ruin the brainstorming session by doing this, but we can always look at current products out there for a little bit of - at least to see how they kind of do some things, and then take some ideas and run with that and kind of develop it into something else.or i mean like a fish is - we're expecting fish is swimming, but some kind of dog. |||| we're not - we shouldn't be talking about those things, though.we should be getting creative. |||| a pod racer!i was gonna move and you put things - \\nfans. |||| pod racer?like the little desert sand like floaty things that go really, really fast. |||| there's worse things out there, but - \\nthere's worse.you're just hating on australia right now. |||| what is the deal with these - \\n\\n- lines?you keep drawing things that . |||| hobby people, yeah, and they've got tons of servos and motors and all sorts of things.okay, we're not sure how the actual bb guns look like, right? |||| these things  in the back here?yeah, we sat there first and then we moved over here. |||| make sure you label things.can i borrow this, tyler, or is this yours? |||| i know what i'm gonna do.i have to like put some things on the treads across the front there. |||| yeah, some things on the treads.yeah! |||| what else?things that fly, but i mean  to fly. |||| we need something that's a toy, so that's fun to play with, not something that helps you do other things.has those play values. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| if you could put all this stuff in, like set it up before you turn the water on in your bath, and as the water comes up they all go to battle.like during the fill-up part of the bath all these things are going around and like find each other. |||| i don't know.we could also make these things with feet that come off kind off, like rock 'em sock 'em robots. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, right?i thought that had play value. |||| i mean these things are  when they spin, but like you could have lights on it.i don't know what would make it - \\ni mean how do we just - ? |||| they were moving around, like those wavelike things, remember those?what was it, beyblades? |||| they were these little spinny top things that like went to battle.kind of like ones with a competitive aspect. |||| i liked things that were on tracks.everybody had hot wheels on tracks or like you could have a roller coaster that connects. |||| let's start off with something that looks like it can be three things already in the first place.anything human form is the easiest thing to replicate. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| for a modular toy, now we have all these car things.i didn't make this one up. |||| when you split it, it becomes multiple things, so like maybe the gun part of it access another gun part, another gun.so you buy the ship and then inside the ship is all the fun things that you would need to have the navy kit, right? |||| not only does that house all your army guys, but it also turns into different things.is that what you're saying? |||| i like the idea of like converting bicycles into things, you know?so like existing bicycle parts? |||| i've always thought like the bell tower could have rockets attached to it, and that's the secret .i don't know any other like student things that are marketable. |||| completely infeasible, but - so you got these two - \\nif you're done with 'em, 15 minutes, you have another hour and ten minutes.also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, okay? |||| there's a few different things you can get at that.we should call it goalie training. |||| this is like - you know what like a  is?so it's just one of those little things and it's got like fins that you can control, little . |||| yeah, see who can hit things the hardest.this would not end well. |||| yeah.people can do all these crazy things  rotate around the things and these . |||| it makes things interesting.let's bring it up. |||| i hear if you hop up on lsd before you come to one of these things you could really get some good ideas.i'm going to do one . |||| i like the idea of making it like a goalie and things are like shooting at the goalie and you have to block as many as possible.but i'm still worried about how do you actually shoot the balls at 'em? |||| maybe it's too simple.no, i don't - i think you're underestimating it a little bit cuz you're gonna have to have four things rotating. |||| yeah, well it hurts - or not.was anyone interested in like things now that we could make into a toy? |||| i don't know, things that you do at this stage of life  that we can make into a toy for someone younger 0:02:58.2.   \\nmost of the games people play our age are like sports.yeah. |||| okay, so we could do the water balloons or chalk-tipped balloons..  those are just minor modifications again to the same things 0:09:34.2.  \\nyeah, i'm still leaning more towards the wind-up cars.wind up car, that's a good - \\nwe can do like an animal of some kind. |||| okay, so let's think about some things about modification and siege equipment 0:12:57.3 or something like that, ballistas or trebuchets, catapults.yeah, all that sort of stuff. |||| or you've got those things at the arcade that are - you've got the hammer and then you hit it.we could do something like that instead but with the air hand pressure thing, so you'd squeeze it and then it would possibly 0:36:01.8 on the red and the thing would go up. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| kind of, but without the flippers.the idea is that you'd have - i'm kinda stuck on this quiz thing, but if everybody has like one of these little things that's like a, b, c, so it's like a multiple choice thing and you put your marble in there and fly down this little tube and go to this track. |||| sure.get things more of a -  \\nwe've got quite a lot of ideas. \",\" you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try

you have a little motor inside, so like - when you have, maybe you like have a - like this is the bottom, looking at it to the side, and then you have like, this sort of ball here.then you just have, you know like an - how the old mouses used to work? |||| our concept was actually 3-d bowling so you could have it, supposed to drive the ball into pins and if it was on a higher ground - \\noh, it'd jump into the - \\nyeah, but i mean, that's dealing with rc and stuff.rc is not bad. |||| was there - \\ni don't know.flying ball i guess? |||| that'd be awesome.if you could just throw little steel ball bearings in there and then if you could somehow control them - i don't know. |||| what do you got going over there?same thing, the magnet ball. |||| oh, magnet ball.yeah. |||| what are those - they have these where it's just a ball and it has .it's got a tail on it or something. |||| yeah.i wonder if you could compress enough air in a little ball and then have it - i'm thinking practical joke type of toy, where you could compress enough air into a ball and then it releases, and it looks like either - it either makes a big splash underwater or it makes it look like someone farted. |||| a fart ball.yeah. |||| yeah.well, if you had a pringles can - like a  can - and it had compressed air at the bottom or a spring, and when you opened the lid, a nerf ball shot out. |||| make a snake that slithers across the floor.wheels - kind of connection which lead to - okay, kinda like the ball and . |||| they try and pay their students to go.did you guys watch the ball state game against them? |||| instead of a little top, you just had a ball and you were trying to kick it.although they might've already done that on a long scale, so i'm trying to think of how to make it different. |||| yeah, i was thinking - \\nsounds like baseball.i'm talking about like a button, not entire thing, and something that doesn't cost 500 bucks, but i'm trying to think of some concept that's not just like kicking a ball. |||| get that sugar high goin'.gatling paint ball gun. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| such simple ideas, but i mean, let's be quite honest, you could do so much with those.we were in spain, and we were on a trip somewhere, and we bought a bouncy ball at a rest stop for our bus. |||| instead of just pushing a button a bunch of times - \\nyou can actually go around to - \\nyeah, you can actually move him around somehow.you could do like little plastic pellets and then a small vacuum or something that has a small ball. |||| what if we did something like that where you had something that you put down and you could somehow aim at somebody else and you fire something, like a nerf ball or - \\nsay each person would have a tower of marbles 42:50.\\nyeah.like they're stationed on top of a tower and say aim at each other's tower until a station falls or something. |||| i'm thinkin' all the easy ones have been done.a ball you can kick, a ball you can throw. |||| like a ball you can kick, a ball you can throw.something that's - movement. |||| with your monkey idea, you could combine that with the paper ball launcher, so it's like the monkey throws the paper .yes. |||| you can tell i'm an engineer cuz that's my ball .i've seen giraffes get height before or walk . |||| the crazy ball hustling toy?that'd be a pain to try to work out. |||| look at the monkey .put ball block up. |||| how do you draw a two-point perspective ball?you could draw a square, a cube, and then - \\nyeah. |||| if you want more blank sheets also just let us know we'll bring you more.just made a ball that when you throw it down the hill it transforms, the wings are kinda - \\nwhere it's going? |||| and use that energy.it has suction cups all around the ball. |||| exactly.or it bounces - \\nonce it bounces back up then it does something, and then it goes back to it's regular position - \\na ball. |||| it becomes like a bird, and then it comes back to a ball - \\nyeah.- and then a bird and a ball. |||| like a hamster has a ball, it's like a trampoline ball.all right. |||| you put the ball inside of a bigger ball with springs.then you just put your hamster in there, roll 'em down the street and he starts bouncin' everywhere. |||| maybe it could be the whole plane long.maybe part of the plane could be a bouncy ball and you bounce it off. |||| $1 million idea.if you could make a ball that would  glider. |||| yeah.cuz i mean, the whole ball, the whole sphere could be a bouncing ball. |||| maybe it's like all around the ball, right?it's not just - so say this is a sphere, right, so it's not just wings like that. |||| - it would be inside the ball.okay. |||| yeah.maybe we can put a hand or something on the ball so it tells the user that hold it from here. |||| i had straws run longitudinally on each side of it.then i had a cotton ball stuck inside there. |||| i mean, it's a ball with slots on it right?a kit. |||| ball that performs a chemical reaction.out of our scope i think. |||| it's a ball that can roll around everywhere.oh, you control it. |||| yeah.it'd be a hollow ball and you put this - \\nput something that rotates inside it. |||| oh, it's spinning inside the ball.would it rotate this way? |||| a ball outside and a ball inside, and the ball inside is spinning this way?yeah. |||| would the whole ball spin this way?yeah. |||| it depends on the weight of each, right?if the outer ball doesn't weigh that much then pretty much the motion is controlled by the thing that's inside, right? |||| should we go for that?are you saying that it would roll up the second ball and then roll back down it or something? |||| i don't know how it would be controlled.ball with remote control. |||| this is a ball that when you roll it down it forms like a glider and then it slides off.it's like the same thing. |||| i like the ball.we either have a ball that when it bounces it becomes something that flies or one that rolls and then flies, either way - \\nthe rolling, it'd be difficult i think because  - \\nhard to get it off the ground then. |||| the wing's gonna hafta be pretty big.bouncy materials are all very dense and heavy so anything - \\ni think it'd make it really stiff like a solid plastic ball, right, cuz - \\nyeah. |||| it's really too big to - \\nwell, i mean - \\n\\n - say you have a small bouncy ball, right?yeah. |||| then how would you solve that the surface inside the ball?then you get those wing's gotta be - \\nyeah. |||| even if you get the ball and even if the ball was this ginormous amount - \\nit has to come down sometime.it's not gonna actually fly once it bounces off. |||| i don't think - \\nmaybe the wings can be - it's hard to explain it.basically, it'd be a little ball thing in here and it flies. |||| the ball's right here.oh. |||| yeah.this is the ball, the center over here. |||| this is the ball, and this is the side of it that it pops out.the way you would attach it i guess would be you'd attach it to a spring, right, that's here. |||| yeah.are you saying put the whole wing inside the ball? |||| it still \\nthe problem with that is it'd hafta be - the ball would hafta hit it at that one spot every time you throw it.you know what i mean? |||| yeah.i mean, you have the top, it'll be a ball so this part'll cut off - \\nright. |||| it's vertical, right, the spring?inside the ball? |||| yeah.the ball - \\nit's spring is like that? |||| do the wings come outta the ball?yes. |||| we google like - \\nflying ball and the first thing you see is - \\n - flying bouncy ball.- like for the exact thing. |||| i'm gonna put a thing on the board.or you do it like a double barrel candy ball shooter, like a shotgun. |||| it's pretty much it's a solid ball when you toss it up and it goes whoop and then you catch it and it goes - yeah.i've seen those. |||| what about like those cubes that you have with the ball, and they're turning around the middle or something.when it comes out how it comes out. |||| they're some little toy called fushigi.pretty much all it is is a completely mirrored ball, but like you can do all this stuff with it, be observer. |||| maybe that can be something that works with the gyroscope.it's just kind of like an optical illusion  that's just a ball. |||| like no matter how you turn it - \\nmovement of dropping while rolling?pretty much it's all one reflective ball, so if you move this ball like here, you could pretty much move it like this, with the ball sitting there even though the ball's rotating. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| just put in more definition, this ball, this sphere.that's probably another ramp for this thing, the same here. |||| i mean i figure everyone would have their own like - \\noh, like the ball starts here?yeah, like a ball would start here and it needs to somehow get over here. |||| the ball starts here.it needs to get over here and then like once it gets here - \\njust write all of that down there, so we'll remember. |||| yeah.but they had it so it was like the bumper here and over here and a bumper there so the ball could shoot over this like ledge. |||| it could go forward, it could go backward.it could go wherever you want so long as there's a ball. |||| you can launch the ball.so you got your goal here and you're gonna have maybe your guy behind it have like a set of triggers here. |||| you've got like a little flipper here and either the pushbutton is electronic or you could use your own hand and just pull down the little flipper.ball rolls in, you let it go and pshoo, pshoo! |||| i can imagine like getting a track system so that the balls come around and they load up in your  hard doing it below the playing field.it'd be easy to just put some kind of little electronic sensor in there that well, one, you'd have like a countdown with a little buzzer and, two, would have like just a little switch so every time a ball passed the goal and dropped down it would count it. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| what about like a miniature golf game and you have to - like you have a little thing and you have to pull it back and swerve it around to try hit the ball on the green or something.so you like the whole course set up? |||| yeah, you could have like the golf course, like a miniature golf course and then you'll just hit the ball.you pull it back and it's like on a spring and then you hit the ball in the or something and you try and shoot it in the hole or something. |||| there would be one ball, big ball.you'd be like hitting this ball and try to get it to a goal here. |||| the marbles would be able to get through but the ball isn't.is this an existing game? |||| like this thing is like hitting some rails and you can like control how high it is by squeezing this thing and it shoots air out and it goes up.you have like another thing that you pull and it shoots a little ball that goes out and try to get into like your opponents goal. |||| inside the water or some liquid and give you the squeeze thing and on the other end, here's a ball and - \\nso it's like basketball?something like that, but it's not as heavy as a basketball. |||| what about like a booby trap of some kind, it shoots out a foam ball you aim or something.like a motion sensor. |||| we could do - it would be like air hockey with a ball and then have the board set up so it's got like different

like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like that and air would come  and push the ball out, so it was like an actual person going for a hoop.yeah, so the toy is like

game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| do you do it manually, or how will you turn - ?well, it would just be like the chess idea, or like you were saying, you have an app where it sends it to the chess board, moves your pieces. |||| same sort of idea.instead of chess pieces, you have army men. |||| instead of a chess board, you have a big mat.but the only thing about that idea is i don't like the app idea. |||| how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| i do like that idea, a gorilla on a huge bicycle like that.that'd be awesome. |||| do you like that idea?i do. |||| i think we should definitely save that idea, though.let's move onto something else and see if we can come up with something else. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| that's not a bad idea.i'm not sure if i could draw that or not. |||| good idea.i suppose we could do a dragon towing a boat, too. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with that idea. |||| do you wanna narrow down on one idea now?i kinda think we probably should get to that. |||| 15 minutes left.we could also expand on this idea. |||| we want you to generate a lot of ideas, and when you get an idea, just make sure you explain it to others, and put it on the wall.okay? |||| yeah.that's not a bad idea. |||| wait, say that again?like instead of this, doing it for like land, doing it like the same idea, but for water. |||| oh, yeah, that's not a bad idea at all.go ahead, draw that. |||| how about like, kinda like what you're saying with the rube goldberg, make it out of water steps where you make like, paths through water, and pinwheels, and kind of like a marble run set, but with water.yeah, that's not a bad idea. |||| you guys want to decide on an idea?at some point we have to pick up a - \\nyeah, we still have 50 minutes, but you know. |||| yeah but i mean, i'm not saying we do something simple, but.like a water roller coaster is a good idea, but it's a lot of stuff you have to build. |||| if he like rotates his arm, it like, lights up this, like \\\"tch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.\\\"that's actually a good idea. |||| it'd be a toy, yeah.our best idea will come out of that. |||| that's not a bad idea.you can interpret that into something, like, a power toy? |||| yeah, i like that idea.a taz? |||| i mean not, not without controllers, like - \\ni think we're getting too caught up in like the workings of it, instead of just the concept itself.focus more on like the main idea, just like, because this is like pretty detailed stuff, which i don't know, we shouldn't worry about it too much, now. |||| the idea is like - \\n'cause like this, this is also like, if you think about it, it's - everything's going to be complicated to do, but it's just like a matter of just - \\ni don't see that being complicated.you spin the arm and you turn a sparkler. |||| you could probably make it where it was like a wind up so it rolls a certain distance and then releases and it pops up.we did have that idea. |||| yeah.or like, what would be the dynamic play idea for that? |||| you guys got any ideas, so we - \\ni like the taz idea, except i just, yeah.that's gonna be a programming . |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| we don't have 24/7.i mean, i think i've got another idea, though. |||| in general - \\ni don't think it'd be terrible though to do, i mean, you just have to kind of figure out some - \\n  to do that project, it's like, something to that idea.yeah, yeah, i understand. |||| yeah, that's a good idea, go to an alarm clock that was weather.we can make like a dragonball z alarm clock. |||| that's a pretty good idea.i don't know what programming would go into that. |||| that's better  'cause then you can just go like this and you can play with someone else, like, come here, come here, it's like, \\\"chh-chh-chh-chh.\\\"yeah, that's a good idea. |||| what?no, we have a children, our idea, you want it to just be negligible. |||| yeah, i've never done complex modeling like that, so i have no idea.i worked on cad for a long time, so, just not, not on pro-e, but i'm trying to get used to it. |||| so what's the idea then to do with that?move the arms? |||| well, basically the idea is move the arms, light up the hair.if we have time we'll integrate the alarm clock. |||| that was on this  perspective for this one, i think.are we each drawing our own idea? |||| last thing you do.that was a cool idea. |||| i'm gonna steal your idea, kind of.you put a sphere with the -   \\nthe lead weight in it? |||| his was open, like cracked and stuff, so if you weren't careful, it'd clip your hand -   \\n  \\n- if you hold it too tight.i kinda like that random motion idea. |||| okay, so this roll would be construction idea?putting it together? |||| hey, this idea - it just came to us.what would happen if you had a magnet in between - or a magnetic - well, no. |||| i think i have pretty good - a decent idea of what it would look like, 'cause you have -   \\n draw it.except that seems like it's a little too front heavy. |||| we haven't used air yet, right?going with the nerf gun idea. |||| okay.going off your idea - do you think we could get enough compressed air to get it to flip from that? |||| .got that idea from class - like construction, like building your - two castles, like two people playing and then having catapults and stuff launching? |||| it's 9:45.  \\n okay.might need to narrow some kind of idea down in some kind of general idea. |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| that'd be neat.i kinda like that idea, 'cause we really - if we just had a - on a  -   \\nslider crank. |||| i don't know.it was an idea a little bit yesterday. |||| okay.how simple of an idea was that? |||| i'm going with the pogo stick idea.there's gotta be something. |||| yeah.that would be a cool idea. |||| i always wanted one of those, but i wanted it to be fully enclosed, so basically, i just wanted a car, but  -   \\n  just a smaller car.- just a smaller car that ran on batteries, so i really had the hybrid idea way before . |||| what else?do you have an idea? |||| covers -   \\ncan we build off that idea somehow?what else could we get it to do? |||| yeah.would you think it'd be a good idea to take 475 and 452, or what combination of the three would you take - 475, 452 -   \\ndo you know what you wanna do? |||| yeah, that's a good idea.or you can do something where if you - \\nhow do you shoot? |||| we're not talking about in a middle of a lake where you have to dive down and retrieve 'em.although that would be cool , but i mean, you could also do one - you could have an idea where you have that little target and every time you hit it, it opens a little door that allows water in, so you have to continuously hit for a little while and it just kinda sinks it. |||| yeah.well,  my first idea was it - my first idea was it triggers it and that triggers a spring that just splits the thing in half. |||| my other idea was you could hit that target and it could open a door and slowly sinks it.that you could do it slowly so it takes a little longer. |||| i like that idea we had up at top that kind of flies different directions somehow.yes. |||| what if we took that battleship idea with toy helicopters?what do you mean by that? |||| you know, we could do so much with that battleship idea.cuz i started thinking we could battle tank - should we do a battle helicopter, battle tank, boat and helicopter? |||| i think it's a great idea.the one above that. |||| the thing is that idea would be so much easier to do with .yeah. |||| with your monkey idea, you could combine that with the paper ball launcher, so it's like the monkey throws the paper .yes. |||| then like you feed a paper wad in its mouth or something and then it comes out the other end and then it flings it.what is another idea? |||| five more minutes of idea generation, boys.oh boy . |||| what about this 01:14:41 idea?what could we do with a light saber game? |||| i like the pirate ship one.i like my cannon idea. |||| is this final concept really final or that's the one we're getting  on?not in , but this has to be sufficiently detailed so you can pitch the idea. |||| it didn't print that on your own.is it one idea per page? |||| get some candy?one idea per page? |||| no.i'm just adding my idea \\noh, so when you spin it you start this small, right? |||| that's a good idea.let's start with trains, like i said. |||| what do they transform to?that's your idea, man. |||| make it four bar.make it \\nsound like a good idea? |||| i don't know.it doesn't over - \\ncuz it's a bad idea. |||| that's a good idea.that's a good idea. |||| take an idea and develop it, our new toy, a new piece of paper.all right. |||| the way you launch it.that's a good idea. |||| spring, that's a good idea \\nyou could put somethin' that pushes back with a spring on it.you could have rubber bands. |||| yeah.that's a cool idea if you could do that. |||| if we actually could figure out how to make it.it's actually $1 million idea. |||| $1 million idea.if you could make a ball that would  glider. |||| oh okay.should we go to some other idea now? |||| no, keep it over here.bad idea. |||| bad idea.all right. |||| it's a good idea, but you can't really do much \\nexactly.i mean, let's think what can we do with that, with the glider? |||| it's a cool idea.it's pretty good. |||| it's a good idea.i like it. |||| i like that idea.it's pretty legit. |||| it's pretty much the same idea.an extension of that idea. |||| i'm not saying about, i'm just saying the idea of havin' a top.oh, just having a top. |||| that's why i think battle trains is the best idea.i think it's too easy. |||| what if we each try to develop this idea and see how it would make it work?okay. |||| you can't steal.this it's our $1 million idea. |||| we have a $10 million idea, so your $1 million idea is negligible.whoa. |||| at the point where it .good idea. |||| right.i mean, if you think about it it's a pretty good idea. |||| it's definitely a $1 million idea.you're sure it's a $1 million idea? |||| i thought it was a $1 million idea.do we need a title for it? |||| yeah.if it flies, if it does everything we said it - like we want it to do it's definitely a $1 million idea cuz i haven't seen anything. |||| i know, right?first result is exactly the same idea. |||| kinda like everything is an idea, is it?did you make it look good? |||| you did.it's a good idea. |||| we need to get away from the gun idea cuz it's not gonna work.we have unlimited budget. |||| you mean my idea?you had a boat. |||| it's the same exact thing as your idea, but on water.why don't we make a hovercraft? |||| i kinda wanna keep going with the candy dispenser idea.i mean i don't know where we could go with it. |||| any kind.i like the smarties idea cuz they're common. |||| a little, like you .only need one idea. |||| hmm?only need one idea. |||| no, like a little - \\nput it on the wall.it's an idea. |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| we're just brainstorming.no, no, i - \\nso i actually kinda like this idea. |||| i like this airboat idea, though.are we gonna be able to actually make it, though? |||| yeah, we're refining the idea.where's the crocodile gonna go? |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| we don't need to print .i like the parachute idea, but how are you gonna deploy it? |||| i don't think , but - \\nit doesn't - if it's all distributed it's not gonna go straight up and straight down, then.that's what your idea would reflect. |||| then the parachute - \\ni'm not gonna go through one.i just went off his idea. |||| what idea - \\ni don't think we have a keeper yet.so what options do we have? |||| that's a great idea.i just - brainstorming, you know? |||| i just stabbed you with this.obviously a bad idea. |||| we need like a marble run for like oreos or something like that.they can wait at the bottom and be like - \\nwell see, that's why i like the marble run idea. |||| what if it had like a mechanical fish that just swam?i feel like you're literally stealing eric's idea. |||| it's like magnetic.i like the idea. |||| it doesn't matter if they already make them.i like the idea, we can run with it. |||| see, i think that's all a big - \\nthat's just a slide, anyway.- idea. |||| making mini sub, like i make mini subs.that's just an idea. |||| the airboat idea is not that hard.the only problem with these - \\nunderwater. |||| like, i think it's a good idea.it's got three second memory. |||| and the cool thing about this is that - \\ni have no idea what this is.- the inside could be completely hollow so there's a bunch of room for us to actually make some mechanical devices in there. |||| that could be a bit dangerous, kids having a needle.i think we should pick an idea and start getting it to be - \\nactually, no. |||| it's an idea.we don't have to have a final concept yet. |||| i'm still goin' with this idea.what if i added like a rooftop? |||| oh my gosh, i forgot about pod racers.he has an idea of pod racing. |||| put it up there.that's a good idea. |||| what is this?the only good idea's over here, all right? |||| i think it's a great idea.they hate it. |||| i .good idea, good idea. |||| so let's pick an idea and go with it.i think these - i don't think any of these could pick as a - you know your line's not straight? |||| the monkey head could float.i kinda think as though we should move away from a boat idea. |||| okay, with your - \\nshould we go back to the gun idea?we're not goin' with the gun idea. |||| why not?it's a bad idea. |||| why is that a bad idea?it's a choking hazard. |||| and that was a terrible idea, and people still died on it.alcoholics are still gonna get the alcohol. |||| i like the tank idea.and it could say america on the side, and then we could annihilate everything. |||| why'd you flip that inside out?it's not a good idea? |||| no, i think it's a bad idea.there's just - \\nit's the idea. |||| okay.by the way, it's a bad idea. |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| we're trying to go with an organized fashion over here.okay, so i guess let's continue with the space tank idea. |||| we never agreed that it was a space tank.all right, tank idea. |||| what if we had hotdogs tank - \\nthat's a bad idea, considering dion here.what? |||| we haven't started a new concept, new idea altogether.we only have like 15, 20 minutes. |||| i think a college student toy would be pretty relatively easy.that's a good idea. |||| it doesn't matter at what stage you decide.it's a good idea to think about that. |||| there you go.get another idea here. |||| if you want it to be - tighten the gap like a mouse or just pull the crank tight.the whole - like the basic idea of like - \\npulling it's faster, but - you could have like that string going around. |||| i think desk toy will be like most  of them, so right now we have two types of desk toys: something that launches and something that's a rocker.i think the launch thing is a desk toy, unless you guys have another idea. |||| that's one idea that we have.what about something else? |||| i like the idea of having a car or some sort of vehicle like a transformer, but still like within the same base.you open it up and it's not that car; it's another car, but when you open the bigger car up the turns into something that the little car uses. |||| that would actually be a cool idea for this one.pretty much like the entire car would actually be modular. |||| i mean you wanna think of something else?i think a modular car is a very, very good idea. |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| i like the idea of like converting bicycles into things, you know?so like existing bicycle parts? |||| well, yeah.hey, you could actually do it - worse idea. |||| i just came up with another idea we could go with.oh, i see what you're saying. |||| i kind of thought - i have an idea what you want to do.some strong concept . |||| or we can all draw a perspective.i'm just saying if we develop this idea properly, what are we doing with that bath toy? |||| partially, but more importantly, you have to get your idea across to someone who's going to be looking at your sheets.it's the concept. |||| depending on what the front wheel was, the idea, it'll like just stay hooked into the boat so the front wheel will stay down and then when we want the thing to come down, this thing will just turn into a rudder so it drives straight.how does it turn into a rudder? |||| no idea is a bad idea.all ideas are good. |||| here, that's an idea.can i have some goddamn candy now? |||| great idea.you don't do the  by this? |||| don't know where i'm goin' with this.this is a bad idea. |||| beat a buddy.steal this idea. |||| i got a jump and go rocket, kinda goin' off the water rocket idea.so it's make a pump? |||| might fall or trip with it.nothing is a silly idea. |||| no idea's a bad idea.i just don't think that would work for a kid toy. |||| let's let that go.i did kinda like my first idea. |||| keep it up, keep it up.one idea, just not this particular project. |||| that's a good idea.then whichever one gets the most votes. |||| i like the idea of making it like a goalie and things are like shooting at the goalie and you have to block as many as possible.but i'm still worried about how do you actually shoot the balls at 'em? |||| you can have one or two guys there, you got the guy in back with the flippers flapping 'em up in front of the goalie.i have no idea how to draw a . |||| all right.so now - \\nwell, so it was your idea, so you can do the sketching, all right? |||| i had no idea to do .this is gonna turn out looking a lot like a star wars guy. |||| i don't think we need to match particularly well, just as long as we have an idea.in fact, i bet if we got a couple different ideas of how we wanted to do this. |||| about the toys idea that you had before, can we elaborate on that maybe?yeah, i just don't see how that's a non-trivial motion. |||| one idea that somebody had that i liked - not that it's something new - is a two player pinball.that was - \\noh, yeah. |||| good idea\\nthat has some sort of mechanical vice on it.like mousetrap or something? |||| how about everybody just do a sketch, an idea?if you could make like a - you know, a crossbow, but then a circular like, inner tube, you know. |||| this is my idea that you have - like this is kinda a takeoff of that quiz thing.you'd have like everybody at the desk would have a like a little catapult or something and there'd be like a bucket for a, b, c, d  put a question above there with the answer and like try to get your answer in the right bucket. |||| and then yeah, by that, you'd have to be able to win somehow.did you have an idea? |||| question torture.somehow combine that with the idea before with the answering quiz. |||| the idea of the journal 0:28:26.1 is that would you shoot your catapult into one of these buckets to answer the question.but if you timed it, like had it using this - see, you didn't actually pull the trigger or whatever, but it was just on a timer so you had to set it to like where you want to aim it. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| that's a pretty good looking duck.i was just thinking we could do this idea before, but have like teams, so this person's trying to attack this one. |||| kind of, but without the flippers.the idea is that you'd have - i'm kinda stuck on this quiz thing, but if everybody has like one of these little things that's like a, b, c, so it's like a multiple choice thing and you put your marble in there and fly down this little tube and go to this track. |||| yeah.it's an idea. |||| it's an idea.you could do like the little marble track thing, but at the end, you'd have like some sort of like paper plane so the marble would like fly into the plane and shoot it off. |||| i like the hover toy idea as well.which one was that? \",\" okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. \",\" i was thinking of combining the army men and the chess game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| we could

sides and you're just supposed to make sure that it goes - \\n?yeah, so going back to your idea, the arduino, we could probably have a plane and then you could specify a path and somehow make it follow a path, the plane or whatever it is. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with

game where you could have like magnets just coming out of the bottom that steers around your army men.yeah, like magnetic or something. |||| can we do that?some of these we can combine, too, like the

and then they shoot out balls.because it's kind of restricted, you can play in that area. |||| yeah, like a - \\na football game.football or something? |||| a football player that tackles another football player.you could have a baseball game where one person positions the player and chooses the trajectory the ball will go in. |||| do something that maybe it - like you build it together, like i don't know how you build it, with like different result.i don't know if any of you played, like, there was a game on the computer like, just, when we were probably like ten years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| my first thought, dur, my first thought was to make it a board game, but that kind of already exists with mousetrap, so.oh. |||| i've always wanted a game that worked entirely from magnets.i don't know. |||| for a game - for tailgating?yeah. |||| it's a one-handed game.what do people do now? |||| i mean, what's the point?it's going in my toy - or game, but it -   \\nit's true. |||| they try and pay their students to go.did you guys watch the ball state game against them? |||| i'm trying to think of an outdoor game that's something simple that two or three kids or a group of kids could play.i'm also trying to think of something simple because i'm sitting there thinking - i was thinking of that torpedo and then i was thinking of bouncy balls. |||| let's see.have you guys ever seen that game online where it's like tooting some - and you just kinda like fireworks and drown 42:26.\\nyeah. |||| destroy something and trash .you mean the old dos game? |||| paper boy - best game ever.i don't think i've ever played that one. |||| elephant .what would be a good challenge game? |||| let's see.what's a fun game? |||| that'd completely change the game.oh, but no, it would because you could put 'em in at different locations. |||| boom.we could use this to make the  the whole   board game kinda thing . |||| love that game.is it still popular? |||| name another game, a video game, a toy.you said super smash brothers. |||| you know what'd be cool, but i think it'd be too big and not feasible 01:11:51.\\nwhat?what if you had like a monopoly 01:11:54 game where like - so let's say i have enough to buy - first of all, the pieces would automatically move around the board, so you would roll dice and you press an electronic dice and it calculates and then it moves it for you. |||| how about a jousting game?a jousting toy? |||| what about this 01:14:41 idea?what could we do with a light saber game? |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| there's actually one game that's actually based on  motion.what? |||| something that you can turn into a game, like a single player game.oh, it's 10:10.  i thought it was 9:10.  oh, we have lots of time, then. |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| last year they had that pinball machine.it was a football game. |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| you'd have to have kids that are three or under or else it gets weird.but you could have like a division and then you could have your actual game, like something launch something there. |||| and then have the game on it where like you launch your soldiers and then how many of your soldiers of yours reach the other end of the pool wins or something.something like that. |||| now, what your job is - this is a game you play with a couple other people, so player one, you sit there facing side one, side one, and it's gonna require all of these at different times, and your job is to knock 'em down out of the air.it'll all go over and you see how many you can knock down. |||| we're the game - \\njust whack him.make a game out of it. |||| we're gonna play a game today.we need someone to volunteer. |||| they have a game called that: russian roulette.ooh! |||| does our toy actually have to move or do we have to move 0:04:48.7 the toy?well, i mean, can we come up with some sort of like game, like an educational game maybe that requires the toy as part of it? |||| like an arcade game or something?yeah, yeah. |||| that could be fun.like two player games, a board game. |||| what about like a miniature golf game and you have to - like you have a little thing and you have to pull it back and swerve it around to try hit the ball on the green or something.so you like the whole course set up? |||| i mean, we did a lot of modifications yesterday or the other day for a gun.like the quiz game, but you'd have to have some sort of electronic interface for that. |||| if we did a board game maybe and had all the pieces movable, like wind-up pieces.you wouldn't actually have to move your piece. |||| okay.i was thinking of like some sort of board game, kind of like be an interactive board game thing. |||| i was trying to think of different ways you can do that.have you ever seen that game, it's kinda like foosball but you have marbles that like shoot and there's like a - so like here you have marbles and they go down and they just shoot across and then there's like a little trap here. |||| the marbles would be able to get through but the ball isn't.is this an existing game? |||| this is an existing game?i was just trying to think of ways to modify that. |||| we could have like an educational game that like say a - you know one of those old timers with the sound in it.you could the sound or whatever and it would come down and you'd have like a sort of scale thing and once it reached a certain weight, it could then trigger like a catapult and your hand would be there so you'd get hit if you hadn't answered the question in time. |||| i was thinking about how somehow like you could be playing like the fast paced game where once the sand runs out, the board explodes or something, like all the pieces like fly off the board.like a hot potato type of thing. |||| the hand, for something for hand pound pressure.the game? |||| you can have like a two-player game, two icons 0:57:38.8 and it's like one each.i can't draw for shit, so - . \",\" how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| do something that

be the - \\nhave like two wheels in the back.how do you spell \\\"wind\\\"? |||| really long x.  it was on wheels.it was like electronic. |||| i think it would be a lot easier to do a penguin or do something on wheels, because i would imagine that the swinging gorilla thing would be really technical.probably. |||| something on wheels which moves on magnets, because - \\nwe could have a gorilla on a giant bicycle with magnetic guns on the side.that'd be awesome. |||| i think it's some sort of like queue with some wheels, and then you just kinda like set it, and it like, starts rotating, like around itself, and it just runs off and you have to chase it around.oh yeah, that'd be kinda the same thing as the ball. |||| yeah.having two wheels where you could steer it. |||| but have like, just marbles, and then have a way to set up a course, kinda like a hot wheels, but miniature.for like a marble to roll through, and stuff? |||| you can like, worry about that later.like this sort of - \\nbut you had left the wheels sticking up. |||| oh.no, were the wheels sticking out here, or? |||| if you have a lot of legs it's not hard at all.yeah, to move the easiest is wheels. |||| propelled by a balloon.it can be propelled by a balloon or the balloon could like, push on a wheel, and then spin the wheels. |||| you need to add something.how about gas-powered power wheels? |||| then what about - \\nso if you'd have a balloon on the car, you'd just make that spin like a little turbine that drives the wheels?it's like, it's pretty simple. |||| oh yeah, but eventually we'll have to.i mean, really only what you have to do to - to see - \\nwhat you have to do with that is just make fairly large wheels, and then put a lot of weight in the bottom. |||| 'cause you want it to like, move everywhere, right?could make it four wheels. |||| yeah, but how does that make it random, though?four wheels? |||| yeah.just do like, the three wheels kind of thing, or just have like the four wheels on the sides, and then a middle ball that just moves randomly. |||| yeah?they had like, little like, wheels here that - a wheel in this direction, like this, that would turn the wheel. |||| basically you have two, like this in front of you, like this, two wheels.that's what contacts the ground? |||| looks like the air up the bag or whatever?yeah, just so it just kinda hovers over the - there's wheels, and i just kinda lowered the coefficient of friction. |||| that's what i was gonna go with.you could make  turn the wheels - trying to build a . |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and then where all the different sections of the snake are connected, with somehow - they'd all articulate so you get that kind of slithering motion. |||| make a snake that slithers across the floor.wheels - kind of connection which lead to - okay, kinda like the ball and . |||| just put a little - you could put -   \\nmr. potato head.- four wheels and a cup holder. |||| -  doing the bottom, wheeling it - yeah.well, if you put wheels on it, then you  wheels on it, then you would have some wheels. |||| it is kinda like a train, too, in the way that the hand - or the cow catcher actually goes.oh, yeah, with the driver on the wheels. |||| and then annotate what - it's not gonna move by the wheels.the driving force is the  cow catcher . |||| yeah, wheels are just there to - i don't even know how to draw a train from the side.what's it look like? |||| i'm not done with my wheels.what time is it? |||| as it goes over the light, the light shuts off.then you could have - so, it's an actual shape with wheels; it's in a maze. |||| there's an airplane where as it moves along, the wheels are on hydraulics basically, so it goes, \\\",\\\" and it rides 01:07:54 coming down.okay. |||| parachutes.what about something like - let's go in the direction of wheels. |||| for what?i think wheels like sliding? |||| sliding?wheels? |||| the wheels would be - it would bend inside when it gets on water.yeah. |||| make the car go side to side and make the wheels - the wheels could turn.yeah. |||| try it again.you could put wheels on top too, so then if it does it'll just roll away. |||| shoes with wheels in the heels.oh, the wheels? |||| there's not much you can do with that other than put wheels on it or springs.springs. |||| it could be a trampoline on wheels.a trampoline on wheels? |||| it has wheels on top and bottom.yeah. |||| i mean, the car would be pretty easy to make, right?all you gotta do is put wheels and springs on it. |||| a hovercraft?where it's got wheels on the bottom and you go kinda, but you can go on the - \\noh, i got it. |||| no, a hovercraft doesn't need wheels.do you know how a  - \\n it is hovercraft. |||| you do realize that if you have four wheels - \\nyeah.- it's not gonna turn. |||| well, what if you had like little turning radius in there?turning radius, you mean - \\nlike a turning - \\nyour wheels turn is what you're . |||| do a two-channel.steering from the fan, but then when it's on ground, steering from the wheels. |||| frequency and - \\nthings of control, so like forward and backward would be one channel cuz it's on the one stick, and left and right would be one channel.maybe the wheels turn with the rudder or the fan. |||| you don't even have to put the wheels on it.you can take the wheels off. |||| could do like .take the wheels off. |||| you just take the wheels off.so it would only be good on the water? |||| like, they're crazy powerful.my neighbor had an fpv that put out 310 kilowatt of back wheels. |||| no, i  - \\nwithout the wheels.i'd just get a steve irwin . |||| it's the same but bigger.without the wheels. |||| it's not gonna move, is it?are you gonna put wheels on the bottom? |||| so i just feel like we're pretty diverse.or they're just trying to - \\nthose are really thick wheels. |||| a mexi car.yeah, like he made - \\n mexicans art kinda like had cars that had wheels that would kinda mount, be on the fenders in the '90s. |||| you call 'em the mexi cars?the utes have the double wheels that like brake outside. |||| why did you draw the other wheels when you're not gonna see them from the body?well no, that's just the front, so you're gonna see that front wheel. |||| they might not do that either, but all i remember is there was just a bunch of cars, like hot wheels.they were always powered. |||| i liked things that were on tracks.everybody had hot wheels on tracks or like you could have a roller coaster that connects. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| or do you wanna make it two wheels.so you could put like a recessed wheel - i was thinking for now you could ignore it. |||| it has - everyone has like the same base, the full wheels with a bunch of connectors on it.then you can put your own doors; your own roof; put a cannon mount on top; and whatever you want to make it look however you want. |||| yeah.or like if we did a wind up plane and instead have like the propellers spinning instead of the actual wheels moving. \",\" i think it

basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. \",\" do we use these sketches?are we what? |||| do we use these?i don't know. |||| so if we have something like a mop kind of a thing attached to it, it would just be used for cleaning.you could use it to do that, and it'd be cleaning at the same time. |||| it matches this little  cap.people actually use this. |||| i was thinking of combining the army men and the chess game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| then if we end up liking that one best, we'll use that one.we've got 40 minutes. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| the to make this age is to like use water.so you can actually see something come out like . |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| pro-e is like, boring.if we could use . |||| yeah, so like basically you use, like you're saying, sorry about the programming, you can use that and just drive all of like two wires to it, just activate the motor and then the rest is just mechanical, so, but like just do, like do what - \\ncan you glue it on first?let's do the head and the arm, and if we want to add the alarm clock, add it later, right? |||| that's actually fine, because like this, we could - like we could use, have this, like as our concept now, and then if we see that it's like way too complicated, we can - \\nyeah.this is kinda fun. |||| could go fine, if it is difficult, you could only use certain dimensions and only got like three features.yeah, so you can do it however you want. |||| should i use this one?i think you can just use what you've got there and outline it. |||| yeah, you could use that, .i'll do what i gotta do. |||| it's like the weird, the awkward size.it's not  enough to like - \\npeople were like, complaining that they wanted like a mini-ipad, like that size, but it's kinda retarded because you like, have a phone that's this, this size, and it's an ipad, like - what in the hell would you use . |||| no, no, no, because like the way samsung, because you know, each phone, like each android, can use like a operating system in a different way.like, htc has a slightly different, like it's just different  and different shortcuts. |||| nice.now use a sharpie. |||| supposed to use fine .what is your guys'? |||| what else do we need?what other kind of motion should we use? |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| but that's - yeah, that's not what we're concerned about.if we use different gear ratios . |||| - we can use the model, i think.yeah. |||| give him a crank - oh, yeah, like a puff air compression?yeah, just get - use a spring that just compresses the air real quick. |||| hm?i really wanna use magnets. |||| this could be a cup holder, and it crawls.but use it when you're eating dinner to pass things to other people across the table. |||| let's design this drastic -   \\nwe can do this.we  fission, but we only use it to do a car. |||| it's got a flatbed, and then it's got the -   \\nokay.yeah, we can't use the - can we use that? |||| that one's pretty damn good.i think you should only use your - my ulterior pen. |||| small like that.just sits on your desk too and use you. |||| well, i mean, if you have - i don't know.if you use something really light, when it - if it cracks open and falls, it might not splatter everywhere. |||| you could have some sort of plastic base that's got a bunch of holes in it that you could make - like you could take pillars and put pillars in the holes.then you could use just loosely interconnecting blocks to make the walls and stuff. |||| we could have something like that.we have a camera in there and you can use facial recognition so it only moves when  - \\nonly moves when no one's looking at it. |||| boom.we could use this to make the  the whole   board game kinda thing . |||| and use that energy.it has suction cups all around the ball. |||| we could also use the same concept where there's chemicals inside.then when you throw it down it performs a reaction - \\nreleases like - \\n - and then it shoots out quickly. |||| aren't we supposed to use sharpies and stuff?i don't know. |||| what would you use as weapons?weapons. |||| every time you wanna do that you gotta use a co2 canister.yeah. |||| didn't he say don't use springs?huh? |||| have a thing that you could do anything you want with it.what can you use besides co2? |||| then your train's done after the first time you use it.yeah. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| yeah.we could only use cotton balls or rubber bands, tape or straws. |||| we have market value cuz they'd always hafta buy a new train - \\n\\n - cuz their train's gonna be destroyed.it's a one-time use. |||| their train's gonna be destroyed after the first use so - \\nit's a terrible toy.right. |||| that way it will be one-time use.you bought it as special collectable trains, like whatever show's on. |||| you try to use energy so even if this is - cuz this needs to be perfectly efficient for it to actually fly.where with a helicopter you can make it 40 percent efficient, and it'll still somehow flutter. |||| cuz you use that energy from spinning.it would just shoot off, if it flies that is. |||| or you could just take apart a remote controlled car and then use that as the base to build off of.do you know what we do with that actually? |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| didn't steve irwin use those?yeah, in the swamps and stuff. |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| -  gonna do is gonna get - \\nhuh?the whole reason - the whole point of this class is so that we can actually use the 3d printers with our pro/e models. |||| we have to use the 3d printers?i don't know if that's the rules, but like - \\ni'm assuming cuz everyone does. |||| dummies can't use it.i feel like children would choke on that and die. |||| look at cigarettes.put in super - put in supervision of parents, or use in supervision of adults. |||| we can use magnets.it would just stop rolling. |||| just use one of those bb guns, if the - \\nand spring load it inside.but automatically. |||| where it just like feels like that.we can actually use it - have fun with army men with this, too. |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| yeah.a lot of people just do like - use trip codes  for  or . |||| do you have a pencil sharpener?yeah i do but i'm not gonna let you use it. |||| let's go with one of my ideas.so really, can i use that sharpener? |||| we could make a smaller version.i mean - \\nor we could - yeah, take that and then actually use - yeah, use the design and design our own. |||| he has a sharpener.yeah, he won't let you use it, either, though. |||| so then the one will be like - yeah.i wish i could use a ruler. |||| i don't know what you would do, but - \\nwhat are you thinking now?it's a car that splits and then you use it for some other reason, though. |||| they use gyroscopes in like space applications, essentially because - let's pivot it there and there.so this is the outer, middle and then on the inside, in this middle you have like a spinning, rotating mass or something. |||| keeps pointing the same way.how do we use it in a toy? |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| the thing is it would work in two, because water and oil don't mix, but if you use two polar liquids, they're gonna mix with each other.what's the deal? |||| actually, i thought of something.instead of using two different fluids, we could use two fluids and a solid, cuz then those definitely will not mix. |||| got a little tank thing that rolls and as your front tires spin it loads the barrel, itself.you can use to fire. |||| you're gonna want to use 'em .oh my god. |||| you use like the - you let it go .teach me. |||| we'll use that one in the military.how'd you win the war? |||| you've got like a little flipper here and either the pushbutton is electronic or you could use your own hand and just pull down the little flipper.ball rolls in, you let it go and pshoo, pshoo! |||| then all the marbles would come back here and come out for that player to use.then like at the top, there would be a bunch of different holes right there, so you'd be able to choose. |||| just some little, a little guy with cars.what can we - can we use like an elastic spring, like a leverage system? \",\" then all the marbles would come back here and come out

right over your fingers? |||| i can make it go like - i can roll it down my arm and .pretty much like at every angle it looks the same. |||| it looks reflective?it looks reflective. |||| let's start

what? |||| crossbow thing looks mean.so it can be anywhere from like 2, 3 up to 12, 15.  oh yeah. |||| instead of having like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like

|||| yeah.but then with the projectile, if this has a lot of energy, you can probably make a roller coaster and then make the whole marble go through it, because if it's fast enough through the - then you shoot that extreme 37:18.\\nso it's like a magnetic popgun. |||| we can probably make a big figure and then using the thing you were talking about, the magnetic thing, and they'd have gorilla fights.have gorilla fights? |||| how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| i mean i guess we could probably just design this and just not even worry about the dart board if it came down to it.yeah. |||| i think it would be a lot easier to do a penguin or do something on wheels, because i would imagine that the swinging gorilla thing would be really technical.probably. |||| do you wanna narrow down on one idea now?i kinda think we probably should get to that. |||| these are the main ideas we've got.probably the gorilla, the gorilla bike. |||| jesse clark did it.so we're saying this one's probably not gonna be it? |||| i think this one's gonna be more practical.i'd probably agree. |||| anybody care to draw a two-point perspective?i suck at it, but i'll probably try. |||| one other thing i always thought would be pretty fun and probably really hard to make, would be something that juggles mechanically.yeah. |||| it can be a fairly simple motion like, you could probably do it with just something spinning in a circle, but you'd have to have a way to catch it, and stuff.put it up there, man. |||| or an octopus, you know how they go like, \\\"fffft.\\\"probably something with candy. |||| do something that maybe it - like you build it together, like i don't know how you build it, with like different result.i don't know if any of you played, like, there was a game on the computer like, just, when we were probably like ten years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| probably should keep going, so i mean, not that we're getting anywhere.huh? |||| not that we're getting anywhere, but we're probably supposed to keep going.yeah. |||| yeah, yeah, yeah.yeah, but if you like, put it in a, a - \\nnozzle and stuff you probably won't - \\nyou can make it, it'd probably just have to be like a flapper of some sort inside of it. |||| you'd probably have too much resistance.i don't think it would go . |||| 'cause you're gonna find, you can buy those.it's probably, the only problem i see with this is - \\nbalance? |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| you could probably make it where it was like a wind up so it rolls a certain distance and then releases and it pops up.we did have that idea. |||| kids.what ages, probably like eight to 12? |||| yeah.probably maybe the front ones, too, to keep it floundering. |||| it's probably .the motor inside's probably . |||| well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they did it with that and they were able to actually move along the lake. |||| yeah.a little submarine probably is pretty trivial motion. |||| there'll probably be rare occasions, though, where the feet moving would combine with the wings and it would fall over.we gotta find . |||| hm.like , i guess, but then you kinda - if it was set on a certain frequency, then it'd probably just cancel it out if it didn't know how - or what position it was in. |||| it'd probably be just like a metal sphere between two magnets and you let it go at one extreme - it might stick to that one, though.if - but if you had - at a certain distance where it wouldn't stick, it would just keep oscillating back and forth for a little while - eventually, this - go to steady state, but for that little while, it'd provide a shaking force. |||| then just weigh it down so it always lands face back up.well, it couldn't be too heavy or else it probably wouldn't flip. |||| you could probably control it using a rudder.it'd be like a . |||| i mean, i guess black powder's a little more -   \\nmm-hmm.probably get a little more power out of that. |||| i wonder if you could get it to rocket up and then have it - sustain it, like - i mean, this is probably getting to be real complicated at that point, but -   \\n  \\nwhat's your major?not . |||| we can't get our own football team on there, but we can get our intermural players, man.that team looked like it could probably beat iu, so that's all. |||| i'm all about simple.we could -   \\nwell, if we were gonna do a two-point perspective where it - it's the easiest two-point perspective one to draw -   \\n  \\n- probably this one that has all the squares. |||| oh, yeah.i'll put a cup holder on it, but i need to - i probably need to -   \\noh, it - 'cause it's - i like it because it's a trivial motion, 'cause it's only forward, but it's a non-traditional way of getting that. |||| i don't know.it'd probably be . |||| we could probably put some sort of counterweight here at the top of it.oh, yeah, like some of those weights so it pushes the hand down? |||| they're probably not gonna enjoy all this cussing on the .they'll just look at team three and they'll look at their list, and it won't be us 'cause we're not team three. |||| i'll probably screw it up and delete it.put in my train profile. |||| yeah.you probably wanna take thermo two. |||| really?probably wanna do thermo two unless you're going into systems and controls. |||| yeah.which - probably not. |||| probably.everybody has a strong opinion about it 'cause you can't be good at all three, i don't think. |||| hm, probably not.i don't know. |||| i'm not very smart, so i guess i'm probably good at one of them.oh, no. |||| i think we should probably - we're probably - although i think firing something, or opening movement and i think that's all considered nontrivial motion.i wonder what trivial motion is. |||| well, it's something my company did at work, but then it got killed before it ever made it to actual production, so i think it'd still be illegal and copying it, wouldn't it?i mean, if you - if you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement, yeah, probably . |||| i feel like drive by is an inappropriate - for little kids.probably. |||| probably should start.i mean, this gives us 20 minutes to narrow it down, so we wanna come up with more ideas for - \\nwell, we do have to do the final one. |||| if it expands out.weight distribution will probably be a good show. |||| african rumble?probably not. |||| yeah, probably not.you know how many mad parents we'd have? |||| we have the boat that sinks in alcohol, float in the water.i think that - \\nprobably not the best for this project. |||| connect four?probably not the best with this bracket. |||| you think we should make some decision matrices or anything like that?probably should. |||| okay, which would be easiest to draw perspective and all that?i think the pac-man probably would. |||| my vote - \\ni'm going with this.this is not less hard - it's probably easiest for us to do. |||| it's probably from the shock\\nonce it fills up with a certain force from hitting the ground then - \\nokay.it basically breaks. |||| you think that'd be enough?the good part about this is that you could probably control exactly how it's rolling once it reached that speed versus the

|||| i really wanna meet up sometime and try to figure that out, though, in a room with a white board.i should probably - no. |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| just push it in?actually, if there's a propeller, then this probably has a crank or a spring loaded. |||| probably not, cuz i don't think we can develop like a computer - \\nwell, i mean if you have the basic parts, then you can.i don't mean like - no software involved. |||| probably better if it doesn't have too many parts, too many small parts.if it was a car we could make something on the scale of like a die cast car. |||| just put in more definition, this ball, this sphere.that's probably another ramp for this thing, the same here. |||| i feel like you could probably - you probably could.i mean if this one was more for like adults, you could go and change parts out, so you could actually have like stronger spring, stronger - so if you actually just want someone -

probably wanna do it on a much bigger, like almost table-size, and so you've got - cuz you need to have at least enough reaction time so that you see it fire and you're able to move your guy and

kids.kids. |||| i'm trying to think of an outdoor game that's something simple that two or three kids or a group of kids could play.i'm also trying to think of something simple because i'm sitting there thinking - i was thinking of that torpedo and then i was thinking of bouncy balls. |||| toys.what video games are popular for little kids? |||| for nontrivial motion, you would.what do kids like playing with? |||| i feel like drive by is an inappropriate - for little kids.probably. |||| do little kids like james bond?i don't know if little kids might, but you might - you might get early teens. |||| i mean, you do it in the bathtub with little kids.they're instead of playin' with rubber ducks they have little spinning tops that they could battle each other with. |||| i've seen some little kids still have that.one of the kids - \\nhe just whips it out. |||| i think we need to start training the modern us kids to fight back so we need to give 'em like 20 missiles.actually, i read - i heard an article on  npr that so many children are becoming obese that a quarter of them aren't fit to fight in the army, so it's a national defense issue. |||| although a smaller army would probably be a good thing cuz we are way too bloated in our army.the kids are - \\nthe navy is. |||| yeah, you - lawsuits.stupid kids. |||| they're like - \\nyou can fish with them?- for little kids, yeah. |||| we can get - buy like a marble run thing and just make it.kids, think kids. |||| kids, keep it simple, stupid.that's not what you're doing. |||| well, i don't - could be a bit dangerous for kids, actually.so dog is actually swimming in the water. |||| that could be a bit dangerous, kids having a needle.i think we should pick an idea and start getting it to be - \\nactually, no. |||| i think we should give the kids these toys in china where they're like - they work in factories and make stuff, and that's their toy.you're terrible. |||| let's not just think college, because we might be limiting ourselves.let's think for kids that are 12 and under also, like do something that would be cool - i don't know. |||| the funny thing is like i notice when you become a college student you pretty much like to play with some of these other toys that are meant for kids.legos and stuff? |||| yeah.like college kids love legos. |||| it's some bowl for kids.it's like gyroscopic, so it's always - when you have something in it, it's always . |||| you'd have to have kids that are three or under or else it gets weird.but you could have like a division and then you could have your actual game, like something launch something there. |||| especially if the little kids shake it up.so it's just two layers again? |||| and good for kids cuz it teaches them, you know, like eat fruit.right. |||| okay, just making sure.all like 25 kids in my grade. |||| some more instructions for you to write up what you did.target customer would probably kids like who don't like their fruit, or who really like their fruit, one of the two. |||| and that's gonna keep kids in the bath.listen, it's a win/win situation. \",\" closest or the farthest object?probably the close - welcome - \\nbecause if it goes to the closest object, it's gonna bang into it, right? |||| then there's like planes coming from all sides and you're just supposed to make sure that it goes - \\n?yeah, so going back to your idea, the arduino, we could probably have a plane and then you could specify a path and somehow make it follow a path, the plane or whatever it is. |||| it just goes down and then you pick it up and you put it back up here.like a rube goldberg machine? |||| it goes through?yeah. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with that idea. |||| you just move the player so that the ball goes in that direction, and then there'll be the person who's batting who - you know like a super motion, and then shoot.that would be a mechanical motion. |||| you'd have a slower motion.you'd have to time it when the person hits, when the ball comes in, and then it just goes back like this, like that. |||| make a little segway?yeah, a kind of segway type of thing but it's just like , goes everywhere. |||| where it like, when it goes off, it just like jumps off your night stand and just starts like, rolling around so you have to go chase it.that's good. |||| yeah, you have to catch it, like in a pool.oh, that sounds - like, still be rc or - \\nno, it just like, goes like random, like it just - \\nbut it's hard to make something move fast that's underwater. |||| i was thinking like, one of the ideas i had was like a, looked like a swing that you like, like push, every time it goes you have to push, and then like the  you have to loop it by pushing buttons.i don't get it, what do you mean, loop it? |||| would we, i mean, electric just turn it on and it goes?yeah. |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| input i guess, yeah.you're gonna do something like that, like the weather's bad, it gets bad and it just goes \\\"fsssssssssss\\\". |||| very, very satisfying in the morning when the alarm goes off.yeah, but, you make it with a catch. |||| yeah, because if you wanna make this rotate, like - \\nyou make it punch like every time you push down, it goes like this.or like this. |||| the only thing is, it's a pulse signal, i'm pretty sure, that goes through a speaker.say like we can just go buy like, those ones that are, there's ones that are like - \\na constant? |||| on the inside.oh, on the other side, or maybe - \\nyou gotta make the arms - \\nit moves like this, choo-choo-choo-choo, and every time the arm goes like this, it - \\nfires the led? |||| yeah, a four-bar linkage, yeah.it just goes, yeah, you'd have a rocker here. |||| mm-hmm.it just goes this much and just with the rotation, it's a constant rotation, and then like have a little, just a little switch that whenever like, this arm goes all the way up front, like makes contact and lights up the led, so it just goes, chh-chh-chh-chh. |||| okay.then we could have kind of two different phases, see how our timing goes. |||| it's like wind's reflecting off, and if someone goes around the sail, it's - all kinds of weird things happen.it's like the magnet on the front of the car. |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| it's just motor with a weight on it, and we don't care if it goes any direction.it could go any direction. |||| you could have this one that goes under .that's what i was just thinking, dude. |||| it's got a screw in it or something so that when it goes, it'll go over the - it'll periodically just go in front and shut the flow off and redirect the flow.i'll show you what i'm talking about. |||| i was telling my girlfriend about this toys  class, and i was telling her to think of ideas for me, and so she suggested - i don't know if you guys are - how long it's been, if you've seen wall-e.  \\nyeah.you know the little cleaning robot that goes around and scrubs? |||| here's what i'm thinking for the actual mechanism inside that does it, though - so you have a ramp thing, so it goes up and then it, what, forces the claw up, and then it -   \\nthen it drops.- then it pulls back, and then it goes back, then it -   \\ni like that, and you just have a wheel, so it's -   \\nit's just - it's like a wheel. |||| it is kinda like a train, too, in the way that the hand - or the cow catcher actually goes.oh, yeah, with the driver on the wheels. |||| what if you have something that has a little base with a spring coil in it or something and just this little lever, and then a little helicopter top that contains - and i don't know what it would contain, but contains something so when you hit this lever, it's already wound up and it just kinda releases the spring and it just flies up and goes someplace.i think there have been similar things to that. |||| the coin goes, \\\"chuu.\\\"yeah. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| ask him.trivial motion would just be like an arm that goes around in circles, but it doesn't do anything. |||| well, first of all, i'm gonna - \\na pac-man toy that drives around; it goes, \\\".\\\"i don't know. |||| as it goes over the light, the light shuts off.then you could have - so, it's an actual shape with wheels; it's in a maze. |||| a wind-up toy where it could pull the cherry out and then it goes up until the cherry gets next to its mouth.nice. |||| like with hungry hungry hippos, it goes out, grabs something, and puts it back and then it rolls to a tray cuz it's stuck on the side.yeah. |||| there's an airplane where as it moves along, the wheels are on hydraulics basically, so it goes, \\\",\\\" and it rides 01:07:54 coming down.okay. |||| that kinda goes along with - \\nthat goes along with - yeah.mars rover? |||| if someone goes for two, four - two and four - this or that.well, that's the four fours together. |||| then it could have some robotic arms that goes out.all right. |||| basically, it just rolls around, and you can control it with a remote control, and it just goes everywhere.does it do anything? |||| it goes everywhere on the walls.yeah. |||| it goes everywhere on the walls.all right. |||| exactly.or it bounces - \\nonce it bounces back up then it does something, and then it goes back to it's regular position - \\na ball. |||| yeah.how would it shoot somethin' out as it bounces and it goes up? |||| they could go like - \\nour toy goes fast on a train.they could go in two directions. |||| maybe mimic a dolphin motion.it jumps out the water, and it goes back in and it jumps out. |||| that would be a crappy toy if you hafta - it goes on for half a second and then you gotta pick it back up.is that like a pinball machine? |||| you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try to jump over things. |||| when it goes when you shoot it off, right - \\nyeah.- it tilts over or something. |||| have a spring that goes like - and then there's prob'ly somethin' attached that sticks outta the car like this.yeah. |||| you control it and then - \\nhow do you control the where it goes?where it rolls - \\n\\n - around? |||| wanders the block and come back down.i think it's - \\nbounces back there, goes back home. |||| how you make this \\n\\nyeah, we got - you hafta wind i guess something that goes to it.is your spring vertical then? |||| you know what i mean?it goes like - \\nyeah. |||| it's like \\n  that way it actually goes higher than what you toss it at.you know what i mean? |||| well yeah, but it does .it goes on land. |||| the only reason you're doing - you're driving on the left hand is cuz you were colonized by - \\nyour left hand goes forward, back, left, like left and right.your steering wheel has to like stop you crashing so you want control with that one. |||| you have an inlet here where water goes in.water goes out over here. |||| - that's like rocket thing, like man on the space with like a thing inside it and then like this balloon thing you jump off and the rocket goes flying up.okay, i need you to explain that to me slowly. |||| a rocket thing here and it's sitting on a base that's got like - and this rocket thing has like a chute built into it and this is space, there's like another one.then there's a pipe coming over here and then the thing that you jump on and it squeezes the air out of this balloon up here and goes boosh and the rocket goes pshew! |||| well, i mean it's not gonna hit the stars.well, i mean - but really, it goes more than eight feet high, abs would break on hard ground. |||| this is the cone.it goes over. |||| - released?if it goes high enough it should just come out . |||| air goes up, so this is hollow, pushes it up.what if we did some sort of an airplane? |||| no one knows what - \\nwell, because the tail goes - \\nit's only got three second memory.- and it just kinda goes really nowhere, but i still like them. |||| ratank, racecar tank's pretty cool.goes 150 miles an hour, burnouts. |||| that's good.so this one goes into exploding. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| i remember the  of one thing.it kinda like - like you toss it up and it kinda like goes up and then like comes back together with the balls that expand and they're like atoms. |||| it's pretty much it's a solid ball when you toss it up and it goes whoop and then you catch it and it goes - yeah.i've seen those. |||| no matter how you put it together it still goes.modular. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| this goes through the middle of this, like this.it's a disk? |||| this button and this thing goes up, takes that .water not included. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just immersed in water and you blow on it, it goes. |||| that's like a rotational - like if the body's rotating and then it comes - and then this is where all the mass is, so like we could put like something that's aerodynamic here so there's more drag up here, more mass down there so his body extends so that he goes into the water with the heavy side down, you know what i mean?yeah. |||| this could be like, \\\"whee,\\\" in human form that just goes .that's awesome, dude. |||| you make like a circle; it goes this way and a circle that goes this way, something like that.did they say to like do these lines? |||| it's like a ufo that kinda levitates, got a big fan, a big fan right in the center.then it goes out to the four corners, four channels on the bottom so it's stable. |||| if you knock down, say, 15 of 'em, then you get 15 points.you load 'em back up into the other side and player two goes, and then it all lines up and he's just trying to knock as many down as he can. |||| you start out with a base vehicle and you can add your own side plates, your own roof, your whatever you want, weights to it, but you won't - everyone has like a similar tip plunger, at least it's the same length.then it goes - it attaches the same size, so back here everything, you can customize it however you want, but everyone's go the same like jousting rods. |||| and the skid .then the skid goes over and the car's stationary. |||| something like that.the guys back here that's got pushbuttons, and as that goes down, those guys come up. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| i don't know how you wind it up.then under here it's got like a propeller, somehow it goes around  or something like that. |||| like this thing is like hitting some rails and you can like control how high it is by squeezing this thing and it shoots air out and it goes up.you have like another thing that you pull and it shoots a little ball that goes out and try to get into like your opponents goal.

doesn't get shot in the face.oh, that's cool. |||| got my tank.that looks cool. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| yeah.that's cool. |||| let's not just think college, because we might be limiting ourselves.let's think for kids that are 12 and under also, like do something that would be cool - i don't know. |||| never mind.actually, college is very cool. |||| carrying around a small one would be kinda cool, small one that packs a punch.yeah, but how do you - sorry. |||| it'd be pretty cool to actually be able to make - \\nsay they all have like rubber band power  or something so they can actually be self-propelled.i like that. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| windup propeller, right?you know what would be cool, though? |||| everything else .that's cool. |||| it is a turbocharger.what if you had like desk toys that are not just like cool; they like do - \\nyou have another hour and ten minutes. |||| oh, okay.yeah, that would be cool, cuz i don't think those toys have been developed to their fullest state. |||| i've seen - i had one a long time ago that was transparent everything, so it was like just plastic on the sides.it was pretty cool. |||| i was like, \\\"yeah.\\\"you know what i thought was a cool thing? |||| gyros are really cool.it's a complicated motion for us to even try. |||| you know what's also cool?those like magnet balls, like you put them together and - \\noh, those are cool. |||| yeah, something magnetic is - \\na magnet would be a cool thing to play with.i'm wondering how a toddler would like that. |||| that would actually be a cool idea for this one.pretty much like the entire car would actually be modular. |||| \\\"god, i gotta dodge these objects, so i'm gonna turn right,\\\" and then if you do turn right, then your chair's actually turning right with you.that'd be kind of cool. |||| yeah.that was pretty cool. |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| that'd be kind of cool.you can always fill a kiddie pool up and do it. |||| you can just change his .you know what would be cool? |||| how about a maze in which you gotta get your boats through and you control the flow of water?that'd be pretty cool. |||| it turns into - it makes a flying thing.yeah, that'd be kinda cool. |||| wasn't that cool when you - ?i was surprised i could do that. |||| that's good.so i think if we put a circle on it would look cool, like this was kinda like . |||| i think it's pretty cool, too.it'd be cool if we could get a couple - if we have like an apple - go go gadget apple, just throw him at . |||| it'd be cool if you had like little springs in 'em so they actually like popped out when you press the button or you pull this down or something.so you're sitting there. |||| comes out with one of your teeth.i'm so happy, this is so cool. |||| like going into it from the beginning.cuz one's cool, but having two to see like the very distinct options. |||| see, that sounds pretty cool.. |||| the thing that could make this pretty cool is the  and proe cuz we could add like little motors in it or we join - we can actually see it like unfold.not run, i mean like see it you can see it starts the orange and you can actually see it like  if we do it right. |||| yeah, that could be cool.they've already done that, but thinking on something like that. |||| yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. |||| yeah, and then it would like hover off the table and you could like twist 0:31:19.0 it around.that's cool. |||| i mean, it would be cool if like you had a transformer and there was like a lever on it or something, like a switch you could pull or something and just by doing that one input, it would like change the whole thing.i feel like that would be incredibly hard to do. \",\" yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. |||| yeah, that could be cool.spring gun. \",\" let's not just think college, because we might

smaller spring on one side, but the launcher works for all your different sets of frogs.you get big fat ones, you can have little skinny ones, ones with little wings on it if you want. \",\" let's do more water ones.that seems possible, right, cuz we got a lot of everyone's. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit

like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. \",\" i had at least ten different clothes, like master

once you got the truck, like space design done and how you're gonna connect it, whether it's just like little pushpins, i think that one would be one of the easier ones.it'd be really the coming up and designing like each of the parts: making doors, making roofs, making rams, making a shield or different colors. |||| if we do the orange, though, i really do think we should try to at least get two different ones.we could do that. |||| yeah, i can see - i don't know if you could do it differently.you could have like - i don't know - some goals like this or like different ones worth different points or something. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. \",\" well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they

concepts. |||| they were these little spinny top things that like went to battle.kind of like ones with a competitive aspect. \",\" or maybe just not make  - or talk it out at least?i guess - should we take off - yeah, take off the ones that didn't get any votes. |||| well, i guess it's more kind of like a brainstorming thing.i always thought the coolest ones were the ones that connect, like there's only five but every one connects to each other. \",\" i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| yeah, let's take off the ones that got zero and one, but we also do - \\nwell, we

you can start from any point, brainstorming and we do a few things later to play value, and of course, because you're designing a toy you want to, caution you to keep the play value ideas in your mind when you are generating your ideas. |||| you should have had enough practice on it by now, okay?also notes to describe your final concept, and also add some notes describing your target customer, okay, it's a toy for kids, so. |||| can it just be any toy, or does it have to be like the motion?i think we just do motion on that, but you can draw anything and then try - think of adding motion. |||| well did the - \\nmake sure the .are we doing just like motion, or the whole toy and everything? |||| yeah, this is your toy.okay. |||| but the toy has to be with like, motion, right?yeah, it has to have motion. |||| we don't have much for this, but you can put it up there.it's not like a full toy but it would be a, i don't know what we'd do with it. |||| it depends what kind of toy we want to, you guys.. |||| oh, we can do a taz too, a taz toy too.we should do that, oh, just like a taz. |||| you've got like, i don't know, just start naming movies like monsters, inc., and toy story.toy story should be - \\nthe dog. |||| put a taser in it?yeah, if you like, rotate something - \\nthe taser toy? |||| it'd be a toy, yeah.our best idea will come out of that. |||| i had a toy when i was a kid, it was very simple but very cool.it was a, you - you inflate a balloon. |||| that's not a bad idea.you can interpret that into something, like, a power toy? |||| huh?how do you - \\nhow do you make the sound in the toy, or how do i make it? |||| yeah, like, the motion is - \\nalready looking forward, that's gonna be hard.'cause to make it like random - \\ndoes your toy have to be largely - 'cause he said not to worry about like, the costs or like the  yet. |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| now, is that really a toy i  or?it's a toy. |||| we could do like a - like a thing, like you hold it like this, imagine that because it's a toy, and just have like a sort of thing that you like, slide down, push down on, and that makes the arm go like this, where like you have two arms that like, i mean like this, and then that, at the same time sparks.sparks it? |||| that would be really neat.kinda like the - what is it - like from toy story, the hand that  . |||| i wonder who the first person was to think of the penach 13:19 toy.oh, yeah. |||| i thought -   \\nwhere that toy museum is?yeah, so it looks like those - they actually have something that can carve out 3d images -   \\noh, really? |||| that'd be a bathroom toy that'd just run - it'd be like a bottom of the tub skimmer, just skim around the bottom.that'd be pretty sweet. |||| make your kids do the housework.next generation of toy is tricking your children into cleaning. |||| yeah.i wonder if you could compress enough air in a little ball and then have it - i'm thinking practical joke type of toy, where you could compress enough air into a ball and then it releases, and it looks like either - it either makes a big splash underwater or it makes it look like someone farted. |||| do you think that would be approved?a shooting toy? |||| we could have something that takes - well, it'd be like more of a pool toy, like kinda - have you ever played with those paint grenades?you know, it like -   \\nlike in paintballing, or -   \\nyeah, yeah, so they have the paint grenades. |||| this is our -   \\noh, right, a motion toy.i would say the motorized cooler, but they already have that. |||| very creepy toy.that would be good. |||| what was the - do you remember what the toy was off of toy story with that's ?the hand? |||| it's a way that - like you could put springs on a segway so you could jump  upstairs.i had a toy. |||| yeah.that was kind of a challenge toy. |||| okay.it's just like that movie big where he was the best toy designer, 'cause really he was a 13-year-old kid. |||| some sort of car or something - yeah, you can sit in it and it propels you across the room - a giant wind-up toy.fission, chris 70:16.    \\nfission? |||| here's what i think.i thought it just had to be a toy that -   \\nyeah. |||| big kid toy.we get to describe our own target market - customer, so we could just say -   \\nforget kids. |||| but it's a tailgate toy.it has to be a closed can, though. |||| i mean, what's the point?it's going in my toy - or game, but it -   \\nit's true. |||| could still have a toy.yeah. |||| what's a toy you always wanted as a child?hmm. |||| let's see.what's a toy? |||| what's a toy?pirate ship. |||| this is off topic.i have not seen a girl in this class, so i'm guessin' we're gonna get a lotta of toy soldiers and boats and cars and stuff, huh? |||| it'd be like an office toy.yeah. |||| what toys could we make for an office that like - let's say engineers or - \\nstressing out and they need a toy to like - \\nexactly.what - and i don't know if this has been done, so tell me if it has. |||| the perfect beach toy .they might even have that already now. |||| what if we took that battleship idea with toy helicopters?what do you mean by that? |||| let's make them both the most annoying toy ever.what would be the most annoying toy ever? |||| well, first of all, i'm gonna - \\na pac-man toy that drives around; it goes, \\\".\\\"i don't know. |||| it would not shut up.i think that's one of the key things that makes a toy annoying. |||| there's a concept right there.the most annoying toy ever . |||| the toy that never dies.you could just imagine that freaking some little kid out. |||| is that labeled as the most annoying toy ever?i said we're annoying. |||| a wind-up toy where it could pull the cherry out and then it goes up until the cherry gets next to its mouth.nice. |||| let's see.an office toy - you think you're day's bad? |||| give me a toy.do we have a favorite ? |||| what is a fun toy?name something else. |||| name another game, a video game, a toy.you said super smash brothers. |||| we could turn that into a toy.i don't know to do - \\na fucking giraffe. |||| how about a jousting game?a jousting toy? |||| i like the most annoying toy ever.yes. |||| yeah, i do like the pac-man one.the most annoying toy ever. |||| the most annoying toy ever.just whole bunch of random things . |||| i do like the most annoying toy as well.i like the remote control shark though. |||| most annoying toy.okay, let's rate this. |||| the crazy ball hustling toy?that'd be a pain to try to work out. |||| yeah.the most annoying toy ever . |||| i don't think so.i think it's just design a toy. |||| just design the thing.design a toy. |||| i was gonna say cuz the market for pac-man might be a little small; the most annoying toy.do we wanna try and add sound with that if we do it? |||| on the first slide it says design a toy with - \\nyeah.oh, in the back of it. |||| oh yeah.you could have some sort of a helicopter toy that hovers. |||| you could have prob'ly something that can hover on water, and then it could start flying, and then also be on land.that'd be one hard toy to design. |||| you could make a fish toy that you could jump out the water with, like flying from water, outside of water like a flying fish.flying fish. |||| they could go like - \\nour toy goes fast on a train.they could go in two directions. |||| some toy like that.wind up . |||| that would be a crappy toy if you hafta - it goes on for half a second and then you gotta pick it back up.is that like a pinball machine? |||| now we can do toy ideas.what? |||| the pegs only fit in certain boxes so you hafta - \\n\\n - means you physically can't build it any other way.sounds like the opposite of toy design. |||| tryin' to think of what we could do with a car.we should go to a different toy. |||| no, i'm talking about a new toy.you'd prob'ly hafta wind it or something. |||| can a shoe be considered a toy though?you could make it. |||| can we make a shoe - \\nthat's - yeah.- that's always a toy? |||| what else can we do?let's think of a toy that's already out there, and then try to redesign. |||| take an idea and develop it, our new toy, a new piece of paper.all right. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| what about this?what should be do with the egg-drop toy? |||| their train's gonna be destroyed after the first use so - \\nit's a terrible toy.right. |||| this toy it would just - \\nit's like you play for half a minute and just - \\nyou could be like something - we could put some kinda sensor in there if it feels a certain force or if one gets knocked over.maybe when you buy it it comes in with a set of trains and attachments, and then you can attach things wherever you want. |||| that's the toy factor, right?is it exciting for a little kid to see something big and it becomes small? |||| we're not gonna be able to print.what sort of - where could we take that for a toy? |||| yeah.but how can we make it unique and a toy? |||| those little toy boats that you put a candle under.wait, let me just - \\nthere's a valve so water in it can only go one way. |||| that's not safe for a kid's toy.you have to have that hollow. |||| it's a kid's toy, right?like, any ages before like 16.  why don't we get like a neil armstrong - \\naction figure. |||| i think we should give the kids these toys in china where they're like - they work in factories and make stuff, and that's their toy.you're terrible. |||| i know.we need to focus on this toy. |||| we need to focus on the toy.you know what would be really cool, is if we took those little smarties and had like a little guy fling 'em like a frisbee, and like a little frisbee. |||| i don't think i can actually write that on a kid's toy.no. |||| i thought you were talkin' about actually like look for toy - \\nno, no, no, no.- tanks and like - okay. |||| well you don't cuz it's a toy.well, you have like a black - like a window. |||| like i don't think having a pendulum that does this is trivial.something that does something to the toy, which in turn i mean makes noise or something. |||| pick an age and then see what activities they do.i wanna toy that i would wanna play with, college student toy. |||| i think a college student toy would be pretty relatively easy.that's a good idea. |||| do we start off with like an age that we wanna do or just like any sort of ?like we just decided to do a college student toy and just go on on that. |||| don't go into too much details.shower toy or bath toys, same thing. |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| or a desk toy.dorm room, desk toy. |||| office toy.office toy, desk toy. |||| yeah.rube goldberg uses current stuff, so desk toy, office toy could again involve the launcher and the office toy could just - your coworker's desk or something. |||| we need something that's a toy, so that's fun to play with, not something that helps you do other things.has those play values. |||| play on the walk, right?toy for the walk. |||| toy for breakfast club.oh, okay. |||| it's powered somehow.we know about it, so that if something changes, this one has auto - \\nyou think making the toy just for everybody  so you'd have to put it back together? |||| like a shower caddy that's a toy as well.it has a . |||| we'll get back to that.dorm room desk toy. |||| this desk toy.i had this little truck that had an airplane on it. |||| i mean it was just a toy.at work there used to be like - actually you had diesel engine parts that were the color of the bathroom pass. |||| i think desk toy will be like most  of them, so right now we have two types of desk toys: something that launches and something that's a rocker.i think the launch thing is a desk toy, unless you guys have another idea. |||| it's all pretty much like that.something that - \\nyou know, like a large-scale - \\nyou think we can brainstorm a little bit, like what kind of toy did you like to play on the way back? |||| yeah, engaging.like a toy where everyone kinda like really be around. |||| so toy plus toy plus toy plus toy.some people wanna, \\\"so i kind of like that one, every single one, and i wanna .\\\" |||| okay.we'd be developing it as one toy as opposed to make three different toys. |||| well, just to go aside it would be better if when we're designing it if we designed the first toy first.make it modular. |||| so that's what a gyroscope is, so what kind of toy do we do that's nontrivial motion, don't just throw it?i mean that would come back into rocker kind of section, which is not a problem. |||| they're some little toy called fushigi.pretty much all it is is a completely mirrored ball, but like you can do all this stuff with it, be observer. |||| i don't think we have the compact toy, either.put it on the modular toys. |||| that's more important in the beginning.later on you can figure out - \\nso a toy that's multiple toys. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| we have another modular toy.let's not limit ourselves to cars, though. |||| for a modular toy, now we have all these car things.i didn't make this one up. |||| a toy in a toy in a toy.what if instead of a toy in a toy, it's like - i mean this is kinda how they did it where it's like toy one and then  two. |||| then you continue this process, so this would be toy two, this would be toy five, this is toy one again, three, four.what does it do? |||| i mean it wouldn't have been .well, unless we think of another modular toy we'll just go with the gyroscope. |||| keeps pointing the same way.how do we use it in a toy? |||| i don't know.that'd be a pretty crazy toy. |||| as a desk toy?it was, like you've played pinball before, right? |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| my boats.i like the bath toy. |||| i really do like the bath, but especially if we can make it maybe modular.like this itself can be modular, but even if that's the only toy that we make, i sort of think it really combines everything that we talked about, so we're really not limiting ourselves depending on where we wanted to put it, like put our focus onto that or . |||| or we can all draw a perspective.i'm just saying if we develop this idea properly, what are we doing with that bath toy? |||| the toy?no. |||| for now, like honestly just making a boat that .i mean kinda like going with the dude toy concept here with the swimmer and the boat. |||| oh, let's hear about it.so, you got like a little plastic toy frog thing, little launcher that, for a lack of better word, is gonna be stick yea wide or so. |||| so - \\nstarted using these football - it wouldn't be a little kid toy, hopefully.you got two, say, eight by eight boxes on either side of you with holes in 'em, and you're lined up so that these different holes here kind of an upward angle, and when it launches one out it'll go into the other corresponding hole. |||| thought of a very destructive toy.destructive toy? |||| don't break my toy.really, like you build it however you want so you can have like this massive tank or this really fast streamlined thing. |||| no idea's a bad idea.i just don't think that would work for a kid toy. |||| making you die.actually, is there anything we could do with that, like another toy, you don't know what's gonna happen when you activate it? |||| an adult toy.i didn't catch that. |||| yeah, well it hurts - or not.was anyone interested in like things now that we could make into a toy? |||| i don't know, things that you do at this stage of life  that we can make into a toy for someone younger 0:02:58.2.   \\nmost of the games people play our age are like sports.yeah. |||| it could be like a dog toy.it could be like a sensory toy for a child. |||| does our toy actually have to move or do we have to move 0:04:48.7 the toy?well, i mean, can we come up with some sort of like game, like an educational game maybe that requires the toy as part of it? |||| i don't really know what girls would play with.barbie, toy horses. |||| we can make an underwater wind-up toy that's a mermaid.my duck is there. |||| if we were doing a wind-up, would we rather do a water toy than a flying thing like a plane?i don't know. |||| i like the hover toy idea as well.which one was that? |||| it's just like a wind-up toy just like, kinda like the one that we - the one based off that kind of, the one where it's kind of like that.instead of like trying to throw it, it's just supposed to like hover around little surfaces. |||| instead of having like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like that and air would come  and push the ball out, so it was like an actual person going for a hoop.yeah, so the toy is like a person, it looks like a person? \",\" we're an approved study which will not affect your grades and i won't, or anybody, grade it, ever see it,  going to improve the raw quality of what we are doing.okay, so your goal today is to design a toy that exhibits a creative, non-trivial motion. |||| can it just be any toy, or does it have to be like the motion?i think we just do motion on that, but you can draw anything and then try - think of adding motion. |||| well did the - \\nmake sure the .are we doing just like motion, or the whole toy and everything? |||| but the toy has to be with like, motion, right?yeah, it has to have motion. |||| yeah, like, the motion is

motion? |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and

build it together, like i don't know how you build it, with like different result.i don't know if any of you played, like, there was a game on the computer like, just, when we were probably like ten years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| i'll write that down.i know like a, kinda like a board like this, and then you'd like, put little different stuffs? |||| they, i mean, there are some of those already, but we could do something different, but.i think there might even be something like this already too. |||| any movie characters or something, to make something from, seen a lot of different reloads in the past.it's hard to top like a, i guess they're like . |||| let's do the balloonist.yeah, like, different things - \\nlike what ways can you get the motion? |||| no, no, no, because like the way samsung, because you know, each phone, like each android, can use like a operating system in a different way.like, htc has a slightly different, like it's just different  and different shortcuts. |||| okay.then we could have kind of two different phases, see how our timing goes. |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's

get -   \\nright. |||| yeah.if they were all different - 'cause sometimes they'd cancel. |||| sometimes they'd amplify, so if they just make it one .would it have to be four different motors, or two - your gear ratios? |||| well, they'd all be connected if they were gear ratios.if they're two different gear ratios then we guarantee they're gonna be different, or -   \\nit would be different frequencies of the spin. |||| but that's - yeah, that's not what we're concerned about.if we use different gear ratios . |||| i think we should all draw different ones.okay. |||| i think we do something - using the tails as rudders or something and then having it just so that we can go in different directions.i don't think that's trivial, because you could say it's always going forward, but -   \\nwell, not necessarily, though. |||| yeah.i don't know if they like - you can give the duck different sized feet, so it kinda makes it - the water catches one part or the other, and then you can get it to do circles, at least. |||| yeah, so you'd have different throwing things.you could have some of them catapults and some trebuchets, some fires a barrage of arrows or something. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and then where all the different sections of the snake are connected, with somehow - they'd all articulate so you get that kind of slithering motion. |||| you could make it school themed, so if you had - like oklahoma is the - has the -   \\nthey're the -   \\n- the sooners have the covered wagon.kinda like you could do it with different mascots. |||| it's a different book.the people that i've been talking to said it was pretty good. |||| i mean, i know we actually kind of arrived on that, but is this what this - the whole thing was for?i hope so, 'cause i  i don't know - one of my teammates on senior design said that they had to do 100 different ideas - 100 different drawings. |||| instead of a little top, you just had a ball and you were trying to kick it.although they might've already done that on a long scale, so i'm trying to think of how to make it different. |||| i like that idea we had up at top that kind of flies different directions somehow.yes. |||| i don't know how to do it.like bumps at certain points so when it spins down, it flies in different directions or - but just something that spins around and - \\nor a weight - like a weight on the inside that could shift somehow. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| something like that.like it was a set that came with, i don't know, different kinds of walls or a cannon or a couple cannons and sand bags, just all sorts of different army things. |||| and you have a tiny camera.maybe these are different in the dark. |||| like you wake up in the morning and it's different.oh. |||| that almost gets into a - \\nor this is - \\noh, you could almost do like a angry birds kinda thing where you set up a structure trying stop from getting knocked over and then you have a cannon that fires different kinds and do different things.yeah. |||| yeah.there was a one where it had like - it was like a handle with all this different stuff coming off of it. |||| it had five options.you could do a mechanical bop it type thing, as to where you have different levers rip 48:38 it and kinda start moving out or untwisting or whatever and one of 'em finally reaches all the way out position, you know, explodes or something. |||| what's the one they have a big pile of different pins and you have to put them all in?i don't - i've never seen that. |||| adult toys.which makes it sound a lot worse and different. |||| that'd completely change the game.oh, but no, it would because you could put 'em in at different locations. |||| well, and you - it's almost - it almost becomes a robotics project.it'd need to move in different way when the lights are out. |||| rolling yeah.well, rolling is a different - \\nit's a different - \\ndifferent. |||| yeah.different axes. |||| i've built one before.what can you make that's different? |||| tryin' to think of what we could do with a car.we should go to a different toy. |||| yeah.i mean, you can always have a different design. |||| i was just saying it different.right. |||| what can we do to make them different?that's why - \\ni think a camera would - something with a camera would be really cool. |||| his desk 30:04.  we may need to stop and go in a completely different direction.what else can we - marble run with oreos. |||| so why don't we have marshmallows - \\ncould be, yeah.- inject like different flavors? |||| then you have like a syringe.you can inject it with like a different flavor. |||| just be two different loaders, right?sure. |||| well, at least we'll remember this for the different multiple ways to - \\ni see.like we could put a little ring at the end of the pull string. |||| okay.we'd be developing it as one toy as opposed to make three different toys. |||| well, i mean we would make three parts and then  together and then when we make them we could make  and then  in all different ways.yeah. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| not only does that house all your army guys, but it also turns into different things.is that what you're saying? |||| they're just different colors, and this guy starts his one ship or two ships and five soldiers or something, and the other guy starts with them, too.it seems more prone to success as a videogame than mechanical. |||| actually, i thought of something.instead of using two different fluids, we could use two fluids and a solid, cuz then those definitely will not mix. |||| cuz this is where you add - i thought you were actually a different signer i thought you were a different signer, actually.what if we have like a little diver dude. |||| yeah, there'd be either like some sort of spring hinge here or maybe you have a smaller spring on one side, but the launcher works for all your different sets of frogs.you get big fat ones, you can have little skinny ones, ones with little wings on it if you want. |||| but you have some sort of like launching mechanism.you load your different frogs in and kangaroos if we wanted to do your little - all into the same launcher and they'd let 'em go and like poom!, take off. |||| different fruits?yeah, cuz you can have it be from like bananas. |||| so - \\nstarted using these football - it wouldn't be a little kid toy, hopefully.you got two, say, eight by eight boxes on either side of you with holes in 'em, and you're lined up so that these different holes here kind of an upward angle, and when it launches one out it'll go into the other corresponding hole. |||| now, what your job is - this is a game you play with a couple other people, so player one, you sit there facing side one, side one, and it's gonna require all of these at different times, and your job is to knock 'em down out of the air.it'll all go over and you see how many you can knock down. |||| there's a few different things you can get at that.we should call it goalie training. |||| or, sorry, hovers.it can hover at different heights and - \\nis it on like a remote control? |||| i think you can build a lot off it in terms of different toys.i'm trying to think of how difficult that would be to actually make. |||| each trigger will pop up shooting a single like flap as a goalie.over here you've got different shooters that have - so you're gonna have the mound, they go, they fall, and if they don't score they kinda come in this track and they come back around, just like gravity, they're rolling back around. |||| then you can have like a bunch of different slots where they could shoot from so they don't know which one it's coming from.have like ten slots or something. |||| once you got the truck, like space design done and how you're gonna connect it, whether it's just like little pushpins, i think that one would be one of the easier ones.it'd be really the coming up and designing like each of the parts: making doors, making roofs, making rams, making a shield or different colors. |||| if we do the orange, though, i really do think we should try to at least get two different ones.we could do that. |||| i don't think we need to match particularly well, just as long as we have an idea.in fact, i bet if we got a couple different ideas of how we wanted to do this. |||| we'll have to look in the different languages in how they pronounce their different fruit.i don't know. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| yeah.we could like put like a propeller at the front where we could have it like on the wings or something different, to customize your own. |||| i was trying to think of different ways you can do that.have you ever seen that game, it's kinda like foosball but you have marbles that like shoot and there's like a - so like here you have marbles and they go down and they just shoot across and then there's like a little trap here. |||| then all the marbles would come back here and come out for that player to use.then like at the top, there would be a bunch of different holes right there, so you'd be able to choose. |||| i was thinking of life sized rock 'em and sock 'em robots where like if you wear 0:26:33.3 just like it shoots with different parts on it and then if the other person punches you and a part of the suit, it like falls off, so when your suit's gone, you lose or something like that.or like something where they punch you somewhere in the - don't their heads shoot up if they - \\nyeah. |||| have different heights 0:32:17.3.  \\nwe, well, yeah.okay, gonna get go, i said, let's just make a rifle for children. |||| yeah, i can see - i don't know if you could do it differently.you could have like - i don't know - some goals like this or like different ones worth different points or something. |||| we could do - it would be like air hockey with a ball and then have the board set up so it's got like different mechanisms in it.if you could hit it into like a track, then it would like roll the ball back to be catapulted and then you could like shoot it - \\nso like a pinball table? |||| there are all those transformers and all those sort of toys.i don't know how we could change that though to make it something different. |||| .so wind-up - \\nlike make it different somehow if we add some more stuff to it maybe. \",\" or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. ||||

go  \\nyeah. |||| they don't really  motions.i mean, they're not got little motors and stuff you could add to it? |||| oh yeah.i'm just sayin' stuff. |||| a kit with rubber bands and stuff.and straws.

- your coworker's desk or something. |||| the funny thing is like i notice when you become a college student you pretty much like to play with some of these other toys that are meant for kids.legos

\\nno, what is a primitive motion? |||| - it says primitive motion or something.yeah. |||| creative nontrivial motion, okay?no other constraint. |||| it's like a spring and bounce out is also motion, right?okay. |||| maybe mimic a dolphin motion.it jumps out the water, and it goes back in and it jumps out. |||| that resemble motion.that motion's like - \\nwhatever you called it. |||| don't get stuck up in trivialities.even with nontrivial motion you can relax it, bring it back later. |||| yeah.then come back and think about motion later. |||| it depends on the weight of each, right?if the outer ball doesn't weigh that much then pretty much the motion is controlled by the thing that's inside, right? |||| it's just gonna come down slowly.you need some forward motion. |||| yeah.then you have the forward motion. |||| or is that just showing the motion?you want me to start - you mean this? |||| no, i'm not kidding.what mechanical motion are we gonna have? |||| you can't just put a fan on it and have that be all - \\nno, that's the rudders, the mechanical motion.that is kinda cool, actually. |||| anyways - \\ncandle pellet hot air balloon.what mechanical, non-trivial motion can we add to it? |||| - is, from what i've seen, it's been motion isn't very predictable.it's a fish. |||| like program it to have like random motion?. |||| it would be hard to get it to go in the right - cuz my point about the fish was that it's kinda hard to actually get some propulsion.but if we could figure - maybe the fin will actually move just for mechanic motion, but we put a fan on an underneath - or this is a hard line and so it actually looks like the fish is pulling it, but really the boat is driving it. |||| what about a crocodile line with the steve irwin thing?with the same mechanical motion of the fish? |||| i think we should have a bunch of alligators inside the boat and then - \\nyou know what we could do is have some sort of a - the croc, alligator, could be purely mechanical, no electrical thing in it, and this line could be like something hollow or something to where it just had a shaft or just really a cable in there pulling, and then like tensioning and then loosening, tensioning and loosening.they could just pull a lever to make some sort of mechanical motion like the fish in an alligator or a crocodile, whatever. |||| it's twisting.it's a - \\noh, the motion. |||| and what's the definition of nontrivial motion?nontrivial is i mean nothing - launching is kind of a trivial thing, but, nontrivial motion is - you've done  and stuff like that. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| a frisbee is trivial motion.something else to do. |||| there's actually one game that's actually based on  motion.what? |||| maybe like swimming guys, cuz that trivial motion is .a guy that swims? |||| gyros are really cool.it's a complicated motion for us to even try. |||| so that's what a gyroscope is, so what kind of toy do we do that's nontrivial motion, don't just throw it?i mean that would come back into rocker kind of section, which is not a problem. |||| just a suggestion: don't get stuck up in trivialities with the nontrivial motion.you can relax it, bring it back later, so just come up with more creative ideas. |||| you just simple - geez - so non-trivial motion.i'm trying to think of non-trivial motion. |||| don't get stuck up in realities, the non-trivial motion.you can relax it, bring it back later, so just come up with more creative ideas. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| about the toys idea that you had before, can we elaborate on that maybe?yeah, i just don't see how that's a non-trivial motion. |||| what about like a booby trap of some kind, it shoots out a foam ball you aim or something.like a motion sensor. |||| it senses motion and like .no, but like slowly 0:40:27.5.  like you could attach it to a door or something and when you open the door, it like shoots at you, you know. |||| what if we made those into like toys with motion and each one would get a

about quad copter?i - well see, i was thinking - \\nlooks like a butterfly. |||| no, i meant like a - you have like a, what am i thinking?a hellcat. |||| what, does it shoot photons?i was thinking about little - \\npzhew, pzhew, pzhew. |||| just the insides, like motors and stuff.i was thinking the same thing. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh, that's pretty cool. |||| i was just thinking a car has multiple parts.i don't - \\ncar problems? |||| i don't know what you would do, but - \\nwhat are you thinking now?it's a car that splits and then you use it for some other reason, though. |||| i don't know what it would do or whatever.what i was thinking of is more like if suppose it was like the navy ship in that one; it splits. |||| yeah, i'm just thinking of it.i'm just wondering how it works. |||| yeah, something super light, or if you make your own paper boat or something like that and the maze is there.so i'm thinking if this is a maze maybe with oil,  but you get in - actually, i don't see how the boat would go in the water on its own unless the piece is the width of the maze, and then you just - i see now. |||| actually, thinking about mazes in water - \\nwhat was your - ?that was just more like a bike tire thing, a bike tire. |||| and then like make the two - \\nwell, i was thinking like 3-d. \\nwell, yeah, that's the way to do it.if it's this way, then just add another board to it. |||| or do you wanna make it two wheels.so you could put like a recessed wheel - i was thinking for now you could ignore it. |||| i was thinking we could actually do - i don't know.i don't even feel like changing this box now. |||| i was thinking about maybe just like .i might be able to make a hinge right here. |||| do - actually thinking about, like how can it be like a transformer thing?yeah, yeah, but it transforms from orange. |||| yeah, that could be cool.they've already done that, but thinking on something like that. |||| i was thinking if you had - you could like make it so you can angle the guns so your shot isn't like straight on.that's just a minor change. |||| yeah, that would be the problem.i was thinking - yeah. |||| yeah, i was thinking more like you know the wind-up car, you used to just be able to pull it back and the thing would spin?so you just pull it back and let go of it? |||| okay.i was thinking of like some sort of board game, kind of like be an interactive board game thing. |||| how about like a - keep thinking about that.kind of like a handheld, pressurized water rocket or something like that. |||| i was thinking of life sized rock 'em and sock 'em robots where like if you wear 0:26:33.3 just like it shoots with different parts on it and then if the other person punches you and a part of the suit, it like falls off, so when your suit's gone, you lose or something like that.or like something where they punch you somewhere in the - don't their heads shoot up if they - \\nyeah. |||| i was thinking about how somehow like you could be playing like the fast paced game where once the sand runs out, the board explodes or something, like all the pieces like fly off the board.like a hot potato type of thing. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| that's a pretty good looking duck.i was just thinking we could do this idea before, but have like teams, so this person's trying to attack this one. \",\" last night, i was thinking it kinda looks like -   \\ni'm not creative enough.i need some jolly rancher candy. |||| yeah.i wonder if you could compress enough air in a little ball and then have it - i'm thinking practical joke type of toy, where you could compress enough air into a ball and then it releases, and it looks like either - it either makes a big splash underwater or it makes it look like someone farted. |||| how about quad copter?i - well see, i was thinking - \\nlooks like a butterfly. |||| it's got motion, but then last night i was thinking it kinda looks like a gymnast in the olympics.oh,

when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| that's what i was doing for the turtle, the air - the water intake would be the mouth, and then it would just shoot out its bottom.just like nature. |||| yeah.i don't know if they like - you can give the duck different

it's just like a little - it's like a one-side rotation, so maybe if we did something like that with water, like in a pool or something, so you had air on the inside and it was pressurized and then you had - i say it was a circle, like a disc or something, and then you just had an outlet on one side at the radius - the extreme radius, and it just spins, and maybe we can get it to fly somehow?like those fireworks that spin and take off? |||| - its power than compressed water, but - that's pressurized.that's doable. |||| just need a big enough pump.or one of those - maybe kinda similar to one of those water rockets you have. |||| i never had water rocket.i never did, either, but i know like - so they -   \\noh, i had one of those. |||| - they just have water in them and -

over here. |||| no, like two liter rockets, like the water rockets.no. |||| i think - \\ncould you actually see what you're - \\nthey already make remote control submarines.they already - \\nyou have to see in the water. |||| well, i don't - could be a bit dangerous for kids, actually.so dog is actually swimming in the water. |||| i wouldn't be  putting 'em under water.they do. |||| this is the side of the boat and - \\nthat's the pollution that got dumped in the water.yeah, it's all gasoline powered. |||| cuz it's at water level cuz they're monkeys.tyler thinks they're gonna sink. |||| i really need some water.aha! |||| as long as it moves on water, that'd be cool.water could be kind of hazardous. |||| doesn't have to be with these - \\nno, i know that, but the weight would lift or push down the boat unless there's enough buoyancy force.here's the water and this thing is floating and put the monkey inside. |||| army men or like navy men, so it's like all water-based and you have like little boats and these dudes on the boats go around and like you can have submarines.i don't know how you'd do it, but i think you could do it. |||| i don't remember anymore, but i remember - \\nhe's got a scuba doll.he can make that little thing like swim in the water and it's awesome. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| if you could put all this stuff in, like set it up before you turn the water on in your bath, and as the water comes up they all go to battle.like during the fill-up part of the bath all these things are going around and like find each other. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| you can still have like that - \\nit's a giant pool of water.kiddie pool. |||| they have a grid and like a map, so like it's red players here and if he pushes this button it shoots like a - something up.like you push it and it's spring-loaded and it just jacks this thing up and takes that thing out of the water. |||| this button and this thing goes up, takes that .water not included. |||| how about a maze in which you gotta get your boats through and you control the flow of water?that'd be pretty cool. |||| or if there's just water everywhere and you blow on it.like a sailboat? |||| yeah, something super light, or if you make your own paper boat or something like that and the maze is there.so i'm thinking if this is a maze maybe with oil,  but you get in - actually, i don't see how the boat would go in the water on its own unless the piece is the width of the maze, and then you just - i see now. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just immersed in water and you blow on it, it goes. |||| actually, thinking about mazes in water - \\nwhat was your - ?that was just more like a bike tire thing, a bike tire. |||| a maze?i don't know how, but i mean maybe a maze with something sensing the transition between water and oil or something. |||| the thing is it would work in two, because water and oil don't mix, but if you use two polar liquids, they're gonna mix with each other.what's the deal? |||| if you put water on the bottom and oil on top and you put water again, what will happen to it?the water and oil would go above the water. |||| yeah.actually, if you wanted to make it - \\nyou could have alcohol mixed with water. |||| that's like a rotational - like if the body's rotating and then it comes - and then this is where all the mass is, so like we could put like something that's aerodynamic here so there's more drag up here, more mass down there so his body extends so that he goes into the water with the heavy side down, you know what i mean?yeah. |||| well, i mean you figure it's like cemented over here, so when the boat's on land it'll just be like this little wheel over here inside the boat.this is the boat, and then when we wanna put down, this thing connects down, say here, whatever, water flows that way. |||| i got a jump and go rocket, kinda goin' off the water rocket idea.so it's make a pump? |||| you fill it full of water, some air in there, you got your hose.when you jump on it all the air that's currently in your little bladder would fly up into the rocket. |||| you've got a large compression in there, large compression water shoots out.pshooo! |||| it's just like water coming out.it's just like acid that comes out. |||| okay, so we could do the water balloons or chalk-tipped balloons..  those are just minor modifications again to the same things 0:09:34.2.  \\nyeah, i'm still leaning more towards the wind-up cars.wind up car, that's a good - \\nwe can do like an animal of some kind. |||| yeah, yeah.fire water balloons, like a catapult that fires water balloons. |||| how about like a - keep thinking about that.kind of like a handheld, pressurized water rocket or something like that. |||| inside the water or some liquid and give you the squeeze thing and on the other end, here's a ball and - \\nso it's like basketball?something like that, but it's not as heavy as a basketball. |||| it's this, and it shoots it into there?yeah, squeeze it, it shoots on the water, the water  same length . |||| i like the wind-up ideas.i like my wind-up water duck. |||| if we were doing a wind-up, would we rather do a water toy than a flying thing like a plane?i don't know. |||| i think i feel that it would probably be a plane in there somewhere, someone could fly already or is that like the two  water duck.if we did like the basketball, like that bit could be on some adjustable distance thing so you can move it back and forth to make it more difficult or easier. \",\" you could do the spinning toss where you battle, but you battle on water.i guess. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just

|||| i'm just saying senior design, you get the whole , the whole time.you work, senior design you work on 24/7. |||| finish your work.that's actually pretty good, man. |||| like, you either, they either make a phone to work with android.well, microsoft was trying to launch the nokia windows phone again. |||| the general shape of the arms is easy, too.good work, team. |||| i'm not really sure if this is troll logic or not, but could you put a fan on a sailboat with -   \\nno.it wouldn't work 'cause it'd be two unbalanced forces? |||| well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they did it with that and they were able to actually move along the lake. |||| 'cause it was really weird, 'cause you'd think it would never work, but it's because there's actually other forces happening that people usually don't think about.'cause you have the backwards force of the fan pushing against the forward thrust of the sail. |||| oh, now we're .depending on what you'd wanna work out of, i'm sure it's the spring. |||| - they just have water in them and - oh, didn't we have a -   \\nthose work very well.- fluids problem like that? |||| those work very well.did you take fluids in the spring? |||| it had water on the inside and then it took off, and you had mass release and then you had thrust -   \\noh, yeah.those'll work very well. |||| that's so much work.oh, yeah. |||| that's definitely a lot of work.that's not something the 3d printer could just do or  at it. |||| just like a two-liter bottle.how does your snake work? |||| what if we had something that would be a cross - that didn't require batteries.what if it was all like - you could store mechanical work somehow, just with springs? |||| here's my two-point perspective hand crawler.good work. |||| is it hard or is it a lot of work?well, the projects are a lot of work - not as much as 352, but then the - but the exams are worse, so . |||| that was the final concept for how it would work.this is more of - how it's gonna looked. |||| what if - oh, the one pac-man could be, but what if we actually had instead of a digital one, a real live one, where you had - i don't know how that'd work.the best i can think of is if you had a bowl that lights up and this little pac-man that you could control. |||| well, it's something my company did at work, but then it got killed before it ever made it to actual production, so i think it'd still be illegal and copying it, wouldn't it?i mean, if you - if you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement, yeah, probably . |||| who do you work for?i'm not working right now, but my design firm up in cleveland, but it was a small pumpkin with a projector at the back, and there's shown a light through to - put it through another pumpkin - a full-size pumpkin, and it'd show the pumpkin face on it, so in the dark, just the light and then every once and awhile, it turns into an evil pumpkin face, so the eyes change and it grins  teeth in the mouth and, \\\"rah, rah, rah, rah,\\\" so the whole form behind it changes. |||| the crazy ball hustling toy?that'd be a pain to try to work out. |||| we just had to do more work to make it - \\nspinning top?i'm not super excited. |||| i'm not sure that would work if it's coming out 01:26:04 the front though.why not? |||| so - i'm just trying to think of something that wouldn't be - \\ni mean, like the sloth would be a little more difficult 01:29:35.  i think if we did get to it, it would be - it's hard to judge based on difficulty.it could be something super simple to work well or you could get something more difficult to work - \\nif you wanna be 100 percent honest, we're just - we can basically narrow our thing down and say that we want something that moves forward, makes - does some kinda motion. |||| i think it's more.i might recount just to be - \\nare we gonna an off button that doesn't work? |||| that might work.if you have a building you just throw it off the building from  ledge and - \\n\\n - it becomes something and it glides down. |||| you couldn't guarantee it would work if you don't drop it high enough.yeah. |||| on it's way - but that wouldn't work.on it's way does it shoot out the wings? |||| i could see how that wouldn't work out with all the - \\ni mean, be in a bathtub - \\nonce it tips over then it's done.you know what i mean? |||| too hard to control.i don't know how it'd work. |||| yeah.which will work if you make 'em throw it upwards - \\nyeah. |||| then once its wings comes out it flies.that would work better. |||| what if we each try to develop this idea and see how it would make it work?okay. |||| like i think people just didn't try to - \\nall right.cuz it could work. |||| i think if you put time and effort on this it could work.definitely cool. |||| we need to get away from the gun idea cuz it's not gonna work.we have unlimited budget. |||| there's a valve, let's say like right here, so it only allows in, nothing out.if you put a little - they work on tea lights, a little - little tiny little candles. |||| and do you know how they work?there's an explosion. |||| well when we do our final concept, when we pick a final one, and then we design like the crap out of it - \\nso i'm gonna try to do an iteration of this that i think would work.the other problem - the other challenge, not problem, with the something air pushing something up, has to be relatively light, so - \\nplastic is light. |||| is - i don't know if an air coil - \\nf22 raptor.- would actually work at a low velocity. |||| would this be something that we control or just something you set and let it go?i think either way would work. |||| do you remember how moments work?yeah, i taught you. |||| i think we should give the kids these toys in china where they're like - they work in factories and make stuff, and that's their toy.you're terrible. |||| sure.i have to work tonight. |||| i mean it was just a toy.at work there used to be like - actually you had diesel engine parts that were the color of the bathroom pass. |||| yeah, add more ages, so we'll work on that one or just make a new one?i would play with that if i was 22. \\njust gonna add more stuff in here, then. |||| we can work out how it works.so there you are inside there, and then you have all that space to do whatever you want. |||| the thing is it would work in two, because water and oil don't mix, but if you use two polar liquids, they're gonna mix with each other.what's the deal? |||| i'm gonna work on the boat a little bit.i can get the initial aspect of it out. |||| they all work off the same launcher and you can have like little frog jumping costume races.so what's - it's ? |||| that'll work.found out today that it takes about 20 minutes from the time i wake up 'til i can be . |||| didn't really work out that way.i really wish i could do that with my . |||| no idea's a bad idea.i just don't think that would work for a kid toy. |||| it might not work.like, it's stuck as an orange and you return it. |||| it is probably the simplest option that we have up there.you gotta remember, we're gonna have, what, like six to eight weeks to work on this. |||| this is like .you'll get a hand work out that way. |||| i don't know how that would work exactly.you could get like a string and tie it to the door and then when the door opens, it pulls the trigger, releases a switch and shoots . |||| all right.do you think we should start picking a few and try work on them? \",\" those work very well.did you take fluids in the spring? \",\" i'm just saying senior design, you get the whole ,

six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| for a modular toy, now we have all these car things.i didn't make this one up. |||| okay, so we could do the water balloons or chalk-tipped

entire car would actually be modular. |||| i mean you wanna think of something else?i think a modular car is a very, very good idea. \",\" then what about - \\nso if you'd have a balloon on the car, you'd just make that spin like a little turbine that drives the wheels?it's like, it's pretty simple. |||| make the car go side to side and make the wheels - the wheels could turn.yeah. |||| i mean,

about something like a roulette wheel where - something has to get this box.you're here and you press a button and this spins and it stops at a certain time  around the box and that's how many drinks

click it into the launcher.x is there, and whether it's timed or it's a release button, but it sits there for a while and the launcher kinda snaps open, frog comes off and flips away. \",\" and you

like a terrible drawing, but - \\nit's a quick drawing.- we could take it somewhere, though, like . \",\" those work very well.did you take fluids in the spring? \",\" what is you add - the gun was a little water cannon, and then you had this little target that didn't take much - \\noh, yeah, targets.like a target that didn't take much force to - \\nyeah, to knock over, so it ends up . \",\" anybody care to draw a two-point perspective?i suck at it, but i'll probably try. |||| i'm all about simple.we could -   \\nwell, if we were gonna do a two-point perspective where it - it's the

something. |||| we have to draw something, choose something, right?i think so. |||| do you wanna draw it?sure. |||| it says, \\\"draw your ideas on the provided sheets of paper only.\\\"i don't know

- think of adding motion. |||| yeah, exactly, like a gyro thing.yeah, if you want, just draw that. |||| yeah.julian 27:48, an octopus if you, if you draw it like you said, like when it's like not with its legs open, like something like that, with the legs like this? |||| oh, yeah, that's not a bad idea at all.go ahead, draw that. |||| draw it.faster. |||| 'cause i do, i can't draw like, nicer eyes,

are gonna be tricky to draw.yeah, not to build, though. |||| i think i have pretty good - a decent idea of what it would look like, 'cause you have -   \\n draw it.except that seems like it's a little

draw that? |||| couldn't make me happier.could we draw the boiler maker or special concept? |||| oh, okay.i could draw the cow catcher. |||| oh, we need to draw just a profile view of the -   \\noh, do we?yeah. |||| yeah, wheels are just there to - i don't even know how to draw a train from the side.what's it look like? |||| i'll just draw horizon.this is a sketch. |||| .thank goodness you can draw. |||| i can only draw - only reason i took this class.i'm not good at it, but i drew it. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| yeah.i don't know how to draw that though. |||| i don't know.just draw a couple moving parts and - \\nyeah. |||| mm-hmm.i should draw these. |||| i don't know how to draw a sloth.hm? |||| i don't know how to draw a sloth.oh, now it's a race. |||| where are the grooves?oh, so - actually about - \\ngo ahead and draw on this one since we're using that one. |||| yeah, let's take off the ones that got zero and one, but we also do - \\nwell, we have ten minutes to draw the - \\nyeah.yes. |||| okay, which would be easiest to draw perspective and all that?i think the pac-man probably would. |||| do we wanna - \\nor a sloth.i don't know how to draw a sloth personally. |||| i mean, we could each draw one and see what looks the best from there.okay. |||| how do you draw a two-point perspective ball?you could draw a square, a cube, and then - \\nyeah. |||| how do you make a sphere ?you draw a circle in each phase and then project them all together. |||| oh, no.i can't draw a circle to save my life. |||| yeah, i don't know how to draw a sphere.then do like - if you have the mouth do - have a motion like that or something. |||| we could have just one person draw or write ideas while everyone collaborates or is it everyone drawing?it doesn't matter? |||| yeah.it doesn't matter because what you're thinking he's not gonna be able to draw. |||| draw it.all right. |||| all right.draw it. |||| we have a long time to go.we just hafta draw these. |||| i guess then we draw one final concept like in two parts \\nwhat?aren't we supposed to develop these concepts? |||| yeah.you wanna draw it? |||| i don't wanna draw this.it's just a sphere. |||| we have 40 minutes left to do a diagram.do you want me to draw this? |||| go ahead .we gotta draw it in two parts. |||| we gotta draw it in two-point sector.okay. |||| all i say is we have 15 minutes to draw something, so let's just - \\nplastic.i mean, you don't need to worry about that right now. |||| then inside of it there are - \\ndraw really lightly \\nwe'll start with the wings i guess.let's say we have - \\nshould we make this two-point perspective on this? |||| we only have a few minutes \\n\\nmake sure when you draw this, the little thing on top, make it go outta the - make it a little higher.what do you mean? |||| draw this.one of these is   bonds then, right? |||| i think you should draw - \\ni just drew \\noh well, draw how it works, so we have step one at least.step two. |||| draw a little more to the right.ah, whatever, so then you can have an arrow. |||| i don't know how to draw a candy shooting pez, something with gun.i'll do top view for it. |||| i'm gonna write candy gun cuz i can't draw.all right, you got any ideas? |||| fuel.you can draw that. |||| you're gonna have to have separate - the hardest part is gonna be making the model as either - because making it look accurate, we're not worried about our limitations right now.you didn't draw - you . |||| where's the force?draw it, free body diagram. |||| so you draw a dog, then try to have those kind of shape in the back, too, so it will be like this.dogfish? |||| so there was nothing else the first - \\nit's really hard to draw an arrow with these stupid squares.it looks like a delta plane. |||| oh, there's the health issues.we gotta draw these with the pro/e , right? |||| might as well draw something already .i think we'll just  for this. |||| a chef's tank.at least i didn't draw a sptank. |||| that's not two points.i'm gonna draw it. |||| need a little bit of - \\n\\ntwo point perspective sucks.but i'll just draw it anyway and without the two point would probably be better than this. |||| why did you draw the other wheels when you're not gonna see them from the body?well no, that's just the front, so you're gonna see that front wheel. |||| like we just have like a little window across the front.hey what, i'll draw a black hole. |||| okay, so we need to draw the - or we need to write, what is it?final design - final conception? |||| so this could be like an amphibian kind of - works both on land and like on dry bath and wet bath.i'll just draw in feet, then. |||| .i'm not really aware of how it works, so you'll have to draw it. |||| that's what i just thought of right now, if you have a maze and you have to get your boats through the maze and you control - \\nso is it like a - ?well, you can draw it. |||| i can't draw that out, okay.sorry. |||| we had four people on that team.all right, so who's gonna draw that? |||| or we can all draw a perspective.i'm just saying if we develop this idea properly, what are we doing with that bath toy? |||| we don't have to think too much about it right now, still.i mean do you wanna draw the dude or the boat? |||| i can only draw a body that's a rough circular body.i was doing the two points thing for a

stay on the track all the time that way.yeah. |||| yeah, like i have a brother who's seven and a sister who's three and they don't like to go to bed, so i was trying to think of something that we could do to entice them to go to bed.like a story time. |||| you'd have a slower motion.you'd have to time it when the person hits, when the ball comes in, and then it just goes back like this, like that. |||| we got time.. |||| okay.your time is almost up, so whatever final concept you sketched, please explicitly write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay? |||| make sure it's all visible, it's all .you continue to  and develop your ideas and we'll give you some time, check marks like you know, you're - we're going to go until about 10:10, okay? |||| awesome.i used to watch it all the time when i was like eight, maybe. |||| i was thinking like, one of the ideas i had was like a, looked like a swing that you like, like push, every time it goes you have to push, and then like the  you have to loop it by pushing buttons.i don't get it, what do you mean, loop it? |||| like, it's like every time you push, it like pushes the swing, like there's a mechanism that pushes the swing.yeah. |||| so like, then you have to push at the right time, and you have to kind of add on to the motion, until it like, spins.oh. |||| i'm just saying senior design, you get the whole , the whole time.you work, senior design you work on 24/7. |||| it's like the - always like in my head, every time he started erasing the board i just like, thought about like that once, and i was like,  \\\"la la la la la la la la la.\\\"oh. |||| runs around.if you don't wake up like in a certain amount of time, it just runs off. |||| we could do like a - like a thing, like you hold it like this, imagine that because it's a toy, and just have like a sort of thing that you like, slide down, push down on, and that makes the arm go like this, where like you have two arms that like, i mean like this, and then that, at the same time sparks.sparks it? |||| yeah, because if you wanna make this rotate, like - \\nyou make it punch like every time you push down, it goes like this.or like this. |||| we should just have this motion, the same time the hair could light up?with one shaft here. |||| on the inside.oh, on the other side, or maybe - \\nyou gotta make the arms - \\nit moves like this, choo-choo-choo-choo, and every time the arm goes like this, it - \\nfires the led? |||| yeah, i've never done complex modeling like that, so i have no idea.i worked on cad for a long time, so, just not, not on pro-e, but i'm trying to get used to it. |||| well, basically the idea is move the arms, light up the hair.if we have time we'll integrate the alarm clock. |||| yeah, if we time manage to make the arms move and the head light quickly, we can try the others.yeah. |||| i mean i like, i like the alarm clock, just i don't know how much time we all have.the modeling is the only difficult part is the hair and the muscle. |||| one piece of candy at a time?oh, no. |||| see, what - it's gotta be easy.you gotta be able to - how we hold the beer and do it at the same time. |||| oh, we got plenty of time.a half hour? |||| if you're not gonna be doing systems - like controls - i wouldn't do 475.  \\nthis guy i was talking to yesterday - he's one of my

time to think.yes, first things first. |||| every - every time you hit it - \\n  it has disposable bullets.well, it'd be in a pool. |||| we're not talking about in a middle of a lake where you have to dive down and retrieve 'em.although that would be cool , but i mean, you could also do one - you could have an idea where you have that little target and every time you hit it, it opens a little door that allows water in, so you have to continuously hit for a little while and it just kinda sinks it. |||| yeah.oh, so open up a little bit at a time. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| also, don't forget all the things we talk about, like play value and so on, right?is this the time when we're talking about nontrivial motion and stuff with that or a rotor? |||| battle forts.say that one more time. |||| at what time do we stop doing this and start working on the final?in ten. |||| yeah, elephants are the only animal that can't jump, so it kinda tries to jump a little bit .it makes a noise - elephant noise every time it tries. |||| what about something like a roulette wheel where - something has to get this box.you're here and you press a button and this spins and it stops at a certain time  around the box and that's how many drinks you have to take? |||| you have to press it at the right time, otherwise you fall off.yeah. |||| back lines didn't line up.okay, your time is almost up, so your final concept is you sketched specifically write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept. |||| little finger skateboards.wow, that's a long time ago. |||| yeah.that was a long time ago. |||| like a one-time bounce.a one-time bounce. |||| at the same time?something like that. |||| if you have a top it's more challenging cuz you have a time limit.wouldn't it tip over? |||| every time you wanna do that you gotta use a co2 canister.yeah. |||| wind a spring or something cuz then you could redo it every time instead of trying to get new canisters every time.yeah. |||| yeah.all the time. |||| we have a long time to go.we just hafta draw these. |||| what was this?maybe they both wind at the same time, the springs. |||| that way it's just user-friendly and you don't hafta worry about which way to place it every time.you just put it wherever, and then it'll just shoot off anywhere. |||| right.i don't think it would restrict it at all cuz it's only gonna be on the ground for a fraction of time. |||| cuz if you throw it from here and you spin it and throw it down, it's obviously not gonna land in that one spot every time no matter how much of a weight you put in.yeah. |||| give it time to adjust then - \\nyeah.yeah. |||| then your train's done after the first time you use it.yeah. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| like in triangles.oh  \\nevery time it hit it was actually bouncing. |||| we have market value cuz they'd always hafta buy a new train - \\n\\n - cuz their train's gonna be destroyed.it's a one-time use. |||| that way it will be one-time use.you bought it as special collectable trains, like whatever show's on. |||| i mean for us it's like, \\\"oh my god, it's transforming\\\", but a little kid it's like - \\nyou'd extend their spin time forever.well i mean, you hafta determine who our audience is exactly. |||| cuz i mean i - \\nif you do it again it's like - \\nwhen i used to play with tops a long time ago i would get tired really quick, like five minutes i'd be, \\\"oh, this is dumb.\\\"all right. |||| if it's something that's very delicate where that shock, once it hits the ground it basically falls off, breaks off, hopeless.wait, could you guarantee that would happen every time? |||| then as you're wrapping it around you're winding the spring at the same time.i don't know. |||| then as you're wrapping it inside you're winding the spring at the same time.you know what i mean? |||| it still \\nthe problem with that is it'd hafta be - the ball would hafta hit it at that one spot every time you throw it.you know what i mean? |||| i think if you put time and effort on this it could work.definitely cool. |||| your time is almost up.whatever final concept you sketched you explicitly write the words final concept on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay? |||| i'm not going to.i won't waste my time with that. |||| which means - \\nmost of the time i hold the steering wheel with my left hand, anyways.well, that's dumb. |||| people die on alcohol all the time.and do you know how many times they've tried to illegalize that and they succeeded once? |||| the way they dress and like talk and they wear like football clothing all the time.kinda like the australian word for redneck. |||| he'd probably watch.would be the first time he saw anything. |||| the first time he saw anything?he only - yeah, i bet he's - i almost guarantee he's a virgin. |||| no.so this is just a waste of time? |||| okay, your time is almost up, so whatever final concepts you've sketched, just explicitly write the words final concept on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay?and you can take all the sheets , put it all back in the folder, and . |||| we've got a little time here.what? |||| we've got a little time here.we've got to pick a good one that we like and - \\ni don't know what's going on here. |||| something that you can turn into a game, like a single player game.oh, it's 10:10.  i thought it was 9:10.  oh, we have lots of time, then. |||| yeah, we've got plenty of time.i don't know why i was hurrying you guys. |||| i've seen - i had one a long time ago that was transparent everything, so it was like just plastic on the sides.it was pretty cool. |||| it's something to expand on.shouldn't spend too much time on it. |||| what is the end time, by the way?i think we have time. |||| we have a little time.ten minutes. |||| he's having a good time.he's holding up a sign that says it's him. |||| your time is almost up, so whatever final concepts you sketched, specifically write the words \\\"final concept\\\" on all the sheets that have your final concept, okay?you can take all the sheets that you pinned to the wall, put it all back in the folder and  the folder down. |||| that'll work.found out today that it takes about 20 minutes from the time i wake up 'til i can be . |||| and you like - \\nflies off and hits your friends and everybody has a good time.so everybody will be like we'll probably break, plays with the top - \\nsure, sure. |||| so you kinda go back and forth running around, jumping and trying to knock these down.you could easy mode where it's just kinda like one at a time and pretty slow or you can do it faster by having it launch more at a faster pace. |||| maybe 'em be - i would probably wanna do it on a much bigger, like almost table-size, and so you've got - cuz you need to have at least enough reaction time so that you see it fire and you're able to move your guy and adjust 'em.it couldn't be this small, otherwise it's - \\n\\n- there's not enough reaction time to - \\nto be able to protect if it got hit and such. |||| you could have like four cars go at the same time.we can do four cars. |||| you load it and it just starts bouncing and every time it bounces again.it doesn't like tip over cuz it's all weighted at the bottom. |||| by the time they catch it it's like it's like a mean monster.that shoot 'em in the face with pepper spray? |||| i can imagine like getting a track system so that the balls come around and they load up in your  hard doing it below the playing field.it'd be easy to just put some kind of little electronic sensor in there that well, one, you'd have like a countdown with a little buzzer and, two, would have like just a little switch so every time a ball passed the goal and dropped down it would count it. |||| or we could have like one a humanoid and one like a four-legged one so they're not just a guy each time.it could turn into like a dog or something. |||| just not the group that - \\n\\nokay, your time is almost up, so what are the final concepts you sketched?you explicitly write the words final concept on the sheets that have your final concept, okay? |||| we could have like an educational game that like say a - you know one of those old timers with the sound in it.you could the sound or whatever and it would come down and you'd have like a sort of scale thing and once it reached a certain weight, it could then trigger like a catapult and your hand would

you try to throw them. |||| should we start writing things?yeah. |||| dragon head that just throws something.what are those things called, those boxes which just pop open? |||| throws things at you.old nerf balls. |||| i mean we could do lots of things with that one.we could have it in be an army officer or something. |||| in fact, we could have him in two armies.we could do a lot of things with that one. |||| okay?your main goal is to brainstorm and be - a lot of what brainstorming and visually you can start from any point, brainstorming and we do a few things later to play value, and of course, because you're designing a toy you want to, caution you to keep the play value ideas in your mind when you are generating your ideas. |||| from whenever we start you're going to 10:10, we start winding down at 10:10 so we collect everything, and so you can figure out when you want to start bounce selecting ideas that your team likes, and what we want when we finish at 10:10 is that we want to have a final concept which is developed in reasonable detail, and i'll explain to you what reasonable detail means.you're pretty much practice a lot of  and so on, so what we mean by detail is  those kinds of things, just for your final concept, okay? |||| also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on.okay, what else? |||| so, you would build like a little world, and you had like, a stairmaster kind of things, and then like balloons, scissors.so like, you would like, put everything together so like the guy would, like one thing would led to the other. |||| it's like just two times his room, just all full of legos, they're like all weird things.what else to do with motion? |||| in spain, there's a tv show that they do that, like, maybe the size of this room and they like, put - they make it like, go through a water tank and then the bubbles move the next part, or things like that.oh, yeah. |||| something similar.what if, what about things in the air? |||| let's do the balloonist.yeah, like, different things - \\nlike what ways can you get the motion? |||| 'cause the other thing was like the stop things here, like, it's kinda neat.i just, i just think you need something like gears and stuff, that's what you . |||| it's like wind's reflecting off, and if someone goes around the sail, it's - all kinds of weird things happen.it's like the magnet on the front of the car. |||| i don't know.children - well, they make those things like you open it, and it's a spring - a slinky thing, and so -   \\nyeah, yeah, yeah, one of those - the snake thing. |||| yeah, so you'd have different throwing things.you could have some of them catapults and some trebuchets, some fires a barrage of arrows or something. |||| this could be a cup holder, and it crawls.but use it when you're eating dinner to pass things to other people across the table. |||| that's like phase two part of it.it could do - if we go tailgate, for tailgate, we could make it do more things. |||| we're all adults here 05:05.\\ngentlemen, it is time to think.yes, first things first. |||| first things first.let's eat this candy. |||| you know what i'm saying, where like you have little levers that are attached to it and you push 'em down.like something specific to other things 06:46 somehow. |||| i mean, it's - \\nyou know what i like?you could tell my creative juices aren't flowing; i'm just remembering things. |||| what if you have something that has a little base with a spring coil in it or something and just this little lever, and then a little helicopter top that contains - and i don't know what it would contain, but contains something so when you hit this lever, it's already wound up and it just kinda releases the spring and it just flies up and goes someplace.i think there have been similar things to that. |||| yeah, so i'm not exactly sure how to draw this concept, but it's kind of like those - you know those things that sit on the desk and they oscillate back and forth in different directions and you've got multiple parts that are moving at one time?yeah. |||| yeah.i love those things. |||| also, don't forget all the things we talk about, like play value and so on, right?is this the time when we're talking about nontrivial motion and stuff with that or a rotor? |||| something like that.like it was a set that came with, i don't know, different kinds of walls or a cannon or a couple cannons and sand bags, just all sorts of different army things. |||| it would not shut up.i think that's one of the key things that makes a toy annoying. |||| that almost gets into a - \\nor this is - \\noh, you could almost do like a angry birds kinda thing where you set up a structure trying stop from getting knocked over and then you have a cannon that fires different kinds and do different things.yeah. |||| yeah.what if you had a light sensor on a shield or something - \\nor a jedi or - \\nget those motorcycle things that they were riding in the woods. |||| the most annoying toy ever.just whole bunch of random things . |||| that's a little  cad will not kill this or the manufacturing.although with rapid prototype, the manufacturing for these things isn't all that bad . |||| if things get really hairy as they supposed to, we can - we won't be dealing with a lotta shit.yeah, but at the same level, like - \\nnumber three will have more room for moving parts though as well. |||| remember tech decks?oh, like the finger things. |||| you have another hour and 10 minutes.also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, right? |||| just rams off those things?yeah. |||| we could - \\nmake things strange.yeah. |||| you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try to jump over things. |||| it's like just adding things to a shoe.you just added some feature. |||| there's prob'ly a lotta these things that - \\nsprings would be pretty cool.then it'd be like a trampoline-type thing you just keep bouncing on it. |||| i know it doesn't make me think of anything else.things that are stable that are just transforming, i mean, those kinda things are already out. |||| you hafta make everything remote control.you wanna just go back to all these ideas, and then just add more things to it or think of it more? |||| people know these crazy things where if the train hits one of the spikes and smack it or something.right. |||| our things were indestructible\\nwow.what'd you make it out of? |||| this toy it would just - \\nit's like you play for half a minute and just - \\nyou could be like something - we could put some kinda sensor in there if it feels a certain force or if one gets knocked over.maybe when you buy it it comes in with a set of trains and attachments, and then you can attach things wherever you want. |||| anything else?car with swings and things. |||| anyway, what do ya think?or just action figures \\nyou would - \\nyou would stick your finger in and then shoot things? |||| you could pick things up - \\noh.- as it's flying. |||| oh, you have things spinning inside of it, right?i think. |||| i mean, i like a lotta those things actually.yeah. |||| i don't know.i mean, there could be things that could be done with it. |||| what do you call those things?one of those. |||| i thought we were doin' the frisbee.what kind of things do you like playin' with? |||| yeah.i don't know what channels are, other than things you watch. |||| frequency and - \\nthings of control, so like forward and backward would be one channel cuz it's on the one stick, and left and right would be one channel.maybe the wheels turn with the rudder or the fan. |||| you throw a lot of things out there and not a lot of 'em are any good.hey, the more the better. |||| well, i guess it would, but if you had just like a servo, really, to just go do do do, and the tail would be up.then we could have it coupled with some of the other things on there, too. |||| we need to have like certain weight - \\nwe can always - i don't wanna ruin the brainstorming session by doing this, but we can always look at current products out there for a little bit of - at least to see how they kind of do some things, and then take some ideas and run with that and kind of develop it into something else.or i mean like a fish is - we're expecting fish is swimming, but some kind of dog. |||| we're not - we shouldn't be talking about those things, though.we should be getting creative. |||| a pod racer!i was gonna move and you put things - \\nfans. |||| pod racer?like the little desert sand like floaty things that go really, really fast. |||| there's worse things out there, but - \\nthere's worse.you're just hating on australia right now. |||| what is the deal with these - \\n\\n- lines?you keep drawing things that . |||| hobby people, yeah, and they've got tons of servos and motors and all sorts of things.okay, we're not sure how the actual bb guns look like, right? |||| these things  in the back here?yeah, we sat there first and then we moved over here. |||| make sure you label things.can i borrow this, tyler, or is this yours? |||| i know what i'm gonna do.i have to like put some things on the treads across the front there. |||| yeah, some things on the treads.yeah! |||| what else?things that fly, but i mean  to fly. |||| we need something that's a toy, so that's fun to play with, not something that helps you do other things.has those play values. |||| that'd be pretty cool.i like things that scuttle in the water. |||| if you could put all this stuff in, like set it up before you turn the water on in your bath, and as the water comes up they all go to battle.like during the fill-up part of the bath all these things are going around and like find each other. |||| i don't know.we could also make these things with feet that come off kind off, like rock 'em sock 'em robots. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, right?i thought that had play value. |||| i mean these things are  when they spin, but like you could have lights on it.i don't know what would make it - \\ni mean how do we just - ? |||| they were moving around, like those wavelike things, remember those?what was it, beyblades? |||| they were these little spinny top things that like went to battle.kind of like ones with a competitive aspect. |||| i liked things that were on tracks.everybody had hot wheels on tracks or like you could have a roller coaster that connects. |||| let's start off with something that looks like it can be three things already in the first place.anything human form is the easiest thing to replicate. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| for a modular toy, now we have all these car things.i didn't make this one up. |||| when you split it, it becomes multiple things, so like maybe the gun part of it access another gun part, another gun.so you buy the ship and then inside the ship is all the fun things that you would need to have the navy kit, right? |||| not only does that house all your army guys, but it also turns into different things.is that what you're saying? |||| i like the idea of like converting bicycles into things, you know?so like existing bicycle parts? |||| i've always thought like the bell tower could have rockets attached to it, and that's the secret .i don't know any other like student things that are marketable. |||| completely infeasible, but - so you got these two - \\nif you're done with 'em, 15 minutes, you have another hour and ten minutes.also, don't forget all the things we talked about like play value and so on, okay? |||| there's a few different things you can get at that.we should call it goalie training. |||| this is like - you know what like a  is?so it's just one of those little things and it's got like fins that you can control, little . |||| yeah, see who can hit things the hardest.this would not end well. |||| yeah.people can do all these crazy things  rotate around the things and these . |||| it makes things interesting.let's bring it up. |||| i hear if you hop up on lsd before you come to one of these things you could really get some good ideas.i'm going to do one . |||| i like the idea of making it like a goalie and things are like shooting at the goalie and you have to block as many as possible.but i'm still worried about how do you actually shoot the balls at 'em? |||| maybe it's too simple.no, i don't - i think you're underestimating it a little bit cuz you're gonna have to have four things rotating. |||| yeah, well it hurts - or not.was anyone interested in like things now that we could make into a toy? |||| i don't know, things that you do at this stage of life  that we can make into a toy for someone younger 0:02:58.2.   \\nmost of the games people play our age are like sports.yeah. |||| okay, so we could do the water balloons or chalk-tipped balloons..  those are just minor modifications again to the same things 0:09:34.2.  \\nyeah, i'm still leaning more towards the wind-up cars.wind up car, that's a good - \\nwe can do like an animal of some kind. |||| okay, so let's think about some things about modification and siege equipment 0:12:57.3 or something like that, ballistas or trebuchets, catapults.yeah, all that sort of stuff. |||| or you've got those things at the arcade that are - you've got the hammer and then you hit it.we could do something like that instead but with the air hand pressure thing, so you'd squeeze it and then it would possibly 0:36:01.8 on the red and the thing would go up. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| kind of, but without the flippers.the idea is that you'd have - i'm kinda stuck on this quiz thing, but if everybody has like one of these little things that's like a, b, c, so it's like a multiple choice thing and you put your marble in there and fly down this little tube and go to this track. |||| sure.get things more of a -  \\nwe've got quite a lot of ideas. \",\" you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try

thing as the ball. |||| it's good.ball. |||| i think it was just - \\ngood candy in the - \\nyou like, that's when you just put the ball in here.make sure you don't miss anything, when you talk about . |||| i like goku, i like - \\ni like the two-wheeled - either that or the ball that kinda balances.yeah, that's what i was thinking. |||| yeah.just do like, the three wheels kind of thing, or just have like the four wheels on the sides, and then a middle ball that just moves randomly. |||| it's like the middle ball, and it's just like that kinda tilts it, and .how do you move that ball? |||| you have a little motor inside, so like - when you have, maybe you like have a - like this is the bottom, looking at it to the side, and then you have like, this sort of ball here.then you just have, you know like an - how the old mouses used to work? |||| our concept was actually 3-d bowling so you could have it, supposed to drive the ball into pins and if it was on a higher ground - \\noh, it'd jump into the - \\nyeah, but i mean, that's dealing with rc and stuff.rc is not bad. |||| was there - \\ni don't know.flying ball i guess? |||| that'd be awesome.if you could just throw little steel ball bearings in there and then if you could somehow control them - i don't know. |||| what do you got going over there?same thing, the magnet ball. |||| oh, magnet ball.yeah. |||| what are those - they have these where it's just a ball and it has .it's got a tail on it or something. |||| yeah.i wonder if you could compress enough air in a little ball and then have it - i'm thinking practical joke type of toy, where you could compress enough air into a ball and then it releases, and it looks like either - it either makes a big splash underwater or it makes it look like someone farted. |||| a fart ball.yeah. |||| yeah.well, if you had a pringles can - like a  can - and it had compressed air at the bottom or a spring, and when you opened the lid, a nerf ball shot out. |||| make a snake that slithers across the floor.wheels - kind of connection which lead to - okay, kinda like the ball and . |||| they try and pay their students to go.did you guys watch the ball state game against them? |||| instead of a little top, you just had a ball and you were trying to kick it.although they might've already done that on a long scale, so i'm trying to think of how to make it different. |||| yeah, i was thinking - \\nsounds like baseball.i'm talking about like a button, not entire thing, and something that doesn't cost 500 bucks, but i'm trying to think of some concept that's not just like kicking a ball. |||| get that sugar high goin'.gatling paint ball gun. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| such simple ideas, but i mean, let's be quite honest, you could do so much with those.we were in spain, and we were on a trip somewhere, and we bought a bouncy ball at a rest stop for our bus. |||| instead of just pushing a button a bunch of times - \\nyou can actually go around to - \\nyeah, you can actually move him around somehow.you could do like little plastic pellets and then a small vacuum or something that has a small ball. |||| what if we did something like that where you had something that you put down and you could somehow aim at somebody else and you fire something, like a nerf ball or - \\nsay each person would have a tower of marbles 42:50.\\nyeah.like they're stationed on top of a tower and say aim at each other's tower until a station falls or something. |||| i'm thinkin' all the easy ones have been done.a ball you can kick, a ball you can throw. |||| like a ball you can kick, a ball you can throw.something that's - movement. |||| with your monkey idea, you could combine that with the paper ball launcher, so it's like the monkey throws the paper .yes. |||| you can tell i'm an engineer cuz that's my ball .i've seen giraffes get height before or walk . |||| the crazy ball hustling toy?that'd be a pain to try to work out. |||| look at the monkey .put ball block up. |||| how do you draw a two-point perspective ball?you could draw a square, a cube, and then - \\nyeah. |||| if you want more blank sheets also just let us know we'll bring you more.just made a ball that when you throw it down the hill it transforms, the wings are kinda - \\nwhere it's going? |||| and use that energy.it has suction cups all around the ball. |||| exactly.or it bounces - \\nonce it bounces back up then it does something, and then it goes back to it's regular position - \\na ball. |||| it becomes like a bird, and then it comes back to a ball - \\nyeah.- and then a bird and a ball. |||| like a hamster has a ball, it's like a trampoline ball.all right. |||| you put the ball inside of a bigger ball with springs.then you just put your hamster in there, roll 'em down the street and he starts bouncin' everywhere. |||| maybe it could be the whole plane long.maybe part of the plane could be a bouncy ball and you bounce it off. |||| $1 million idea.if you could make a ball that would  glider. |||| yeah.cuz i mean, the whole ball, the whole sphere could be a bouncing ball. |||| maybe it's like all around the ball, right?it's not just - so say this is a sphere, right, so it's not just wings like that. |||| - it would be inside the ball.okay. |||| yeah.maybe we can put a hand or something on the ball so it tells the user that hold it from here. |||| i had straws run longitudinally on each side of it.then i had a cotton ball stuck inside there. |||| i mean, it's a ball with slots on it right?a kit. |||| ball that performs a chemical reaction.out of our scope i think. |||| it's a ball that can roll around everywhere.oh, you control it. |||| yeah.it'd be a hollow ball and you put this - \\nput something that rotates inside it. |||| oh, it's spinning inside the ball.would it rotate this way? |||| a ball outside and a ball inside, and the ball inside is spinning this way?yeah. |||| would the whole ball spin this way?yeah. |||| it depends on the weight of each, right?if the outer ball doesn't weigh that much then pretty much the motion is controlled by the thing that's inside, right? |||| should we go for that?are you saying that it would roll up the second ball and then roll back down it or something? |||| i don't know how it would be controlled.ball with remote control. |||| this is a ball that when you roll it down it forms like a glider and then it slides off.it's like the same thing. |||| i like the ball.we either have a ball that when it bounces it becomes something that flies or one that rolls and then flies, either way - \\nthe rolling, it'd be difficult i think because  - \\nhard to get it off the ground then. |||| the wing's gonna hafta be pretty big.bouncy materials are all very dense and heavy so anything - \\ni think it'd make it really stiff like a solid plastic ball, right, cuz - \\nyeah. |||| it's really too big to - \\nwell, i mean - \\n\\n - say you have a small bouncy ball, right?yeah. |||| then how would you solve that the surface inside the ball?then you get those wing's gotta be - \\nyeah. |||| even if you get the ball and even if the ball was this ginormous amount - \\nit has to come down sometime.it's not gonna actually fly once it bounces off. |||| i don't think - \\nmaybe the wings can be - it's hard to explain it.basically, it'd be a little ball thing in here and it flies. |||| the ball's right here.oh. |||| yeah.this is the ball, the center over here. |||| this is the ball, and this is the side of it that it pops out.the way you would attach it i guess would be you'd attach it to a spring, right, that's here. |||| yeah.are you saying put the whole wing inside the ball? |||| it still \\nthe problem with that is it'd hafta be - the ball would hafta hit it at that one spot every time you throw it.you know what i mean? |||| yeah.i mean, you have the top, it'll be a ball so this part'll cut off - \\nright. |||| it's vertical, right, the spring?inside the ball? |||| yeah.the ball - \\nit's spring is like that? |||| do the wings come outta the ball?yes. |||| we google like - \\nflying ball and the first thing you see is - \\n - flying bouncy ball.- like for the exact thing. |||| i'm gonna put a thing on the board.or you do it like a double barrel candy ball shooter, like a shotgun. |||| it's pretty much it's a solid ball when you toss it up and it goes whoop and then you catch it and it goes - yeah.i've seen those. |||| what about like those cubes that you have with the ball, and they're turning around the middle or something.when it comes out how it comes out. |||| they're some little toy called fushigi.pretty much all it is is a completely mirrored ball, but like you can do all this stuff with it, be observer. |||| maybe that can be something that works with the gyroscope.it's just kind of like an optical illusion  that's just a ball. |||| like no matter how you turn it - \\nmovement of dropping while rolling?pretty much it's all one reflective ball, so if you move this ball like here, you could pretty much move it like this, with the ball sitting there even though the ball's rotating. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| so it's pretty much a maze of where you're trying to make a ball go and the complexity is you find different systems to make it travel through, like maybe an air-conditioning system.your goal is to actually rotate the car to get the ball from the front all the way to the back through five or six different things \\ni think it would be difficult. |||| just put in more definition, this ball, this sphere.that's probably another ramp for this thing, the same here. |||| i mean i figure everyone would have their own like - \\noh, like the ball starts here?yeah, like a ball would start here and it needs to somehow get over here. |||| the ball starts here.it needs to get over here and then like once it gets here - \\njust write all of that down there, so we'll remember. |||| yeah.but they had it so it was like the bumper here and over here and a bumper there so the ball could shoot over this like ledge. |||| it could go forward, it could go backward.it could go wherever you want so long as there's a ball. |||| you can launch the ball.so you got your goal here and you're gonna have maybe your guy behind it have like a set of triggers here. |||| you've got like a little flipper here and either the pushbutton is electronic or you could use your own hand and just pull down the little flipper.ball rolls in, you let it go and pshoo, pshoo! |||| i can imagine like getting a track system so that the balls come around and they load up in your  hard doing it below the playing field.it'd be easy to just put some kind of little electronic sensor in there that well, one, you'd have like a countdown with a little buzzer and, two, would have like just a little switch so every time a ball passed the goal and dropped down it would count it. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| what about like a miniature golf game and you have to - like you have a little thing and you have to pull it back and swerve it around to try hit the ball on the green or something.so you like the whole course set up? |||| yeah, you could have like the golf course, like a miniature golf course and then you'll just hit the ball.you pull it back and it's like on a spring and then you hit the ball in the or something and you try and shoot it in the hole or something. |||| there would be one ball, big ball.you'd be like hitting this ball and try to get it to a goal here. |||| the marbles would be able to get through but the ball isn't.is this an existing game? |||| like this thing is like hitting some rails and you can like control how high it is by squeezing this thing and it shoots air out and it goes up.you have like another thing that you pull and it shoots a little ball that goes out and try to get into like your opponents goal. |||| inside the water or some liquid and give you the squeeze thing and on the other end, here's a ball and - \\nso it's like basketball?something like that, but it's not as heavy as a basketball. |||| what about like a booby trap of some kind, it shoots out a foam ball you aim or something.like a motion sensor. |||| we could do - it would be like air hockey with a ball and then have the board set up so it's got like different mechanisms in it.if you could hit it into like a track, then it would like roll the ball back to be catapulted and then you could like shoot it - \\nso like a pinball table? |||| instead of having like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like that and air would come  and push the ball out, so it was like an actual person going for a hoop.yeah, so the toy is like

you're just supposed to make sure that it goes - \\n?yeah, so going back to your idea, the arduino, we could probably have a plane and then you could specify a path and somehow make it follow a path, the plane or whatever it is. |||| and then it just follows the line to the destination.sort of like build on this army man idea where you're drawing that. |||| maybe that could be it.we had to come up with an idea to make the intersection at western and stadium. |||| that's a good idea.i'll try. |||| this is my last candy.i like that idea. |||| i was thinking of combining the army men and the chess game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| do you do it manually, or how will you turn - ?well, it would just be like the chess idea, or like you were saying, you have an app where it sends it to the chess board, moves your pieces. |||| same sort of idea.instead of chess pieces, you have army men. |||| instead of a chess board, you have a big mat.but the only thing about that idea is i don't like the app idea. |||| how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| i do like that idea, a gorilla on a huge bicycle like that.that'd be awesome. |||| do you like that idea?i do. |||| i think we should definitely save that idea, though.let's move onto something else and see if we can come up with something else. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| that's not a bad idea.i'm not sure if i could draw that or not. |||| good idea.i suppose we could do a dragon towing a boat, too. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with that idea. |||| do you wanna narrow down on one idea now?i kinda think we probably should get to that. |||| 15 minutes left.we could also expand on this idea. |||| we want you to generate a lot of ideas, and when you get an idea, just make sure you explain it to others, and put it on the wall.okay? |||| yeah.that's not a bad idea. |||| wait, say that again?like instead of this, doing it for like land, doing it like the same idea, but for water. |||| oh, yeah, that's not a bad idea at all.go ahead, draw that. |||| how about like, kinda like what you're saying with the rube goldberg, make it out of water steps where you make like, paths through water, and pinwheels, and kind of like a marble run set, but with water.yeah, that's not a bad idea. |||| you guys want to decide on an idea?at some point we have to pick up a - \\nyeah, we still have 50 minutes, but you know. |||| yeah but i mean, i'm not saying we do something simple, but.like a water roller coaster is a good idea, but it's a lot of stuff you have to build. |||| if he like rotates his arm, it like, lights up this, like \\\"tch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.\\\"that's actually a good idea. |||| it'd be a toy, yeah.our best idea will come out of that. |||| that's not a bad idea.you can interpret that into something, like, a power toy? |||| yeah, i like that idea.a taz? |||| i mean not, not without controllers, like - \\ni think we're getting too caught up in like the workings of it, instead of just the concept itself.focus more on like the main idea, just like, because this is like pretty detailed stuff, which i don't know, we shouldn't worry about it too much, now. |||| the idea is like - \\n'cause like this, this is also like, if you think about it, it's - everything's going to be complicated to do, but it's just like a matter of just - \\ni don't see that being complicated.you spin the arm and you turn a sparkler. |||| you could probably make it where it was like a wind up so it rolls a certain distance and then releases and it pops up.we did have that idea. |||| yeah.or like, what would be the dynamic play idea for that? |||| you guys got any ideas, so we - \\ni like the taz idea, except i just, yeah.that's gonna be a programming . |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| we don't have 24/7.i mean, i think i've got another idea, though. |||| in general - \\ni don't think it'd be terrible though to do, i mean, you just have to kind of figure out some - \\n  to do that project, it's like, something to that idea.yeah, yeah, i understand. |||| yeah, that's a good idea, go to an alarm clock that was weather.we can make like a dragonball z alarm clock. |||| that's a pretty good idea.i don't know what programming would go into that. |||| that's better  'cause then you can just go like this and you can play with someone else, like, come here, come here, it's like, \\\"chh-chh-chh-chh.\\\"yeah, that's a good idea. |||| what?no, we have a children, our idea, you want it to just be negligible. |||| yeah, i've never done complex modeling like that, so i have no idea.i worked on cad for a long time, so, just not, not on pro-e, but i'm trying to get used to it. |||| so what's the idea then to do with that?move the arms? |||| well, basically the idea is move the arms, light up the hair.if we have time we'll integrate the alarm clock. |||| that was on this  perspective for this one, i think.are we each drawing our own idea? |||| last thing you do.that was a cool idea. |||| i'm gonna steal your idea, kind of.you put a sphere with the -   \\nthe lead weight in it? |||| his was open, like cracked and stuff, so if you weren't careful, it'd clip your hand -   \\n  \\n- if you hold it too tight.i kinda like that random motion idea. |||| okay, so this roll would be construction idea?putting it together? |||| hey, this idea - it just came to us.what would happen if you had a magnet in between - or a magnetic - well, no. |||| i think i have pretty good - a decent idea of what it would look like, 'cause you have -   \\n draw it.except that seems like it's a little too front heavy. |||| we haven't used air yet, right?going with the nerf gun idea. |||| okay.going off your idea - do you think we could get enough compressed air to get it to flip from that? |||| .got that idea from class - like construction, like building your - two castles, like two people playing and then having catapults and stuff launching? |||| it's 9:45.  \\n okay.might need to narrow some kind of idea down in some kind of general idea. |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| that'd be neat.i kinda like that idea, 'cause we really - if we just had a - on a  -   \\nslider crank. |||| i don't know.it was an idea a little bit yesterday. |||| okay.how simple of an idea was that? |||| i'm going with the pogo stick idea.there's gotta be something. |||| yeah.that would be a cool idea. |||| i always wanted one of those, but i wanted it to be fully enclosed, so basically, i just wanted a car, but  -   \\n  just a smaller car.- just a smaller car that ran on batteries, so i really had the hybrid idea way before . |||| what else?do you have an idea? |||| covers -   \\ncan we build off that idea somehow?what else could we get it to do? |||| yeah.would you think it'd be a good idea to take 475 and 452, or what combination of the three would you take - 475, 452 -   \\ndo you know what you wanna do? |||| yeah, that's a good idea.or you can do something where if you - \\nhow do you shoot? |||| we're not talking about in a middle of a lake where you have to dive down and retrieve 'em.although that would be cool , but i mean, you could also do one - you could have an idea where you have that little target and every time you hit it, it opens a little door that allows water in, so you have to continuously hit for a little while and it just kinda sinks it. |||| yeah.well,  my first idea was it - my first idea was it triggers it and that triggers a spring that just splits the thing in half. |||| my other idea was you could hit that target and it could open a door and slowly sinks it.that you could do it slowly so it takes a little longer. |||| i like that idea we had up at top that kind of flies different directions somehow.yes. |||| what if we took that battleship idea with toy helicopters?what do you mean by that? |||| you know, we could do so much with that battleship idea.cuz i started thinking we could battle tank - should we do a battle helicopter, battle tank, boat and helicopter? |||| i think it's a great idea.the one above that. |||| the thing is that idea would be so much easier to do with .yeah. |||| with your monkey idea, you could combine that with the paper ball launcher, so it's like the monkey throws the paper .yes. |||| then like you feed a paper wad in its mouth or something and then it comes out the other end and then it flings it.what is another idea? |||| five more minutes of idea generation, boys.oh boy . |||| what about this 01:14:41 idea?what could we do with a light saber game? |||| i like the pirate ship one.i like my cannon idea. |||| is this final concept really final or that's the one we're getting  on?not in , but this has to be sufficiently detailed so you can pitch the idea. |||| it didn't print that on your own.is it one idea per page? |||| get some candy?one idea per page? |||| no.i'm just adding my idea \\noh, so when you spin it you start this small, right? |||| that's a good idea.let's start with trains, like i said. |||| what do they transform to?that's your idea, man. |||| make it four bar.make it \\nsound like a good idea? |||| i don't know.it doesn't over - \\ncuz it's a bad idea. |||| that's a good idea.that's a good idea. |||| take an idea and develop it, our new toy, a new piece of paper.all right. |||| the way you launch it.that's a good idea. |||| spring, that's a good idea \\nyou could put somethin' that pushes back with a spring on it.you could have rubber bands. |||| yeah.that's a cool idea if you could do that. |||| if we actually could figure out how to make it.it's actually $1 million idea. |||| $1 million idea.if you could make a ball that would  glider. |||| oh okay.should we go to some other idea now? |||| no, keep it over here.bad idea. |||| bad idea.all right. |||| it's a good idea, but you can't really do much \\nexactly.i mean, let's think what can we do with that, with the glider? |||| it's a cool idea.it's pretty good. |||| it's a good idea.i like it. |||| i like that idea.it's pretty legit. |||| it's pretty much the same idea.an extension of that idea. |||| i'm not saying about, i'm just saying the idea of havin' a top.oh, just having a top. |||| that's why i think battle trains is the best idea.i think it's too easy. |||| what if we each try to develop this idea and see how it would make it work?okay. |||| you can't steal.this it's our $1 million idea. |||| we have a $10 million idea, so your $1 million idea is negligible.whoa. |||| at the point where it .good idea. |||| right.i mean, if you think about it it's a pretty good idea. |||| it's definitely a $1 million idea.you're sure it's a $1 million idea? |||| i thought it was a $1 million idea.do we need a title for it? |||| yeah.if it flies, if it does everything we said it - like we want it to do it's definitely a $1 million idea cuz i haven't seen anything. |||| i know, right?first result is exactly the same idea. |||| kinda like everything is an idea, is it?did you make it look good? |||| you did.it's a good idea. |||| we need to get away from the gun idea cuz it's not gonna work.we have unlimited budget. |||| you mean my idea?you had a boat. |||| it's the same exact thing as your idea, but on water.why don't we make a hovercraft? |||| i kinda wanna keep going with the candy dispenser idea.i mean i don't know where we could go with it. |||| any kind.i like the smarties idea cuz they're common. |||| a little, like you .only need one idea. |||| hmm?only need one idea. |||| no, like a little - \\nput it on the wall.it's an idea. |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| we're just brainstorming.no, no, i - \\nso i actually kinda like this idea. |||| i like this airboat idea, though.are we gonna be able to actually make it, though? |||| yeah, we're refining the idea.where's the crocodile gonna go? |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| we don't need to print .i like the parachute idea, but how are you gonna deploy it? |||| i don't think , but - \\nit doesn't - if it's all distributed it's not gonna go straight up and straight down, then.that's what your idea would reflect. |||| then the parachute - \\ni'm not gonna go through one.i just went off his idea. |||| what idea - \\ni don't think we have a keeper yet.so what options do we have? |||| that's a great idea.i just - brainstorming, you know? |||| i just stabbed you with this.obviously a bad idea. |||| we need like a marble run for like oreos or something like that.they can wait at the bottom and be like - \\nwell see, that's why i like the marble run idea. |||| what if it had like a mechanical fish that just swam?i feel like you're literally stealing eric's idea. |||| it's like magnetic.i like the idea. |||| it doesn't matter if they already make them.i like the idea, we can run with it. |||| see, i think that's all a big - \\nthat's just a slide, anyway.- idea. |||| making mini sub, like i make mini subs.that's just an idea. |||| the airboat idea is not that hard.the only problem with these - \\nunderwater. |||| like, i think it's a good idea.it's got three second memory. |||| and the cool thing about this is that - \\ni have no idea what this is.- the inside could be completely hollow so there's a bunch of room for us to actually make some mechanical devices in there. |||| that could be a bit dangerous, kids having a needle.i think we should pick an idea and start getting it to be - \\nactually, no. |||| it's an idea.we don't have to have a final concept yet. |||| i'm still goin' with this idea.what if i added like a rooftop? |||| oh my gosh, i forgot about pod racers.he has an idea of pod racing. |||| put it up there.that's a good idea. |||| what is this?the only good idea's over here, all right? |||| i think it's a great idea.they hate it. |||| i .good idea, good idea. |||| so let's pick an idea and go with it.i think these - i don't think any of these could pick as a - you know your line's not straight? |||| the monkey head could float.i kinda think as though we should move away from a boat idea. |||| okay, with your - \\nshould we go back to the gun idea?we're not goin' with the gun idea. |||| why not?it's a bad idea. |||| why is that a bad idea?it's a choking hazard. |||| and that was a terrible idea, and people still died on it.alcoholics are still gonna get the alcohol. |||| i like the tank idea.and it could say america on the side, and then we could annihilate everything. |||| why'd you flip that inside out?it's not a good idea? |||| no, i think it's a bad idea.there's just - \\nit's the idea. |||| okay.by the way, it's a bad idea. |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| we're trying to go with an organized fashion over here.okay, so i guess let's continue with the space tank idea. |||| we never agreed that it was a space tank.all right, tank idea. |||| what if we had hotdogs tank - \\nthat's a bad idea, considering dion here.what? |||| we haven't started a new concept, new idea altogether.we only have like 15, 20 minutes. |||| i think a college student toy would be pretty relatively easy.that's a good idea. |||| it doesn't matter at what stage you decide.it's a good idea to think about that. |||| there you go.get another idea here. |||| if you want it to be - tighten the gap like a mouse or just pull the crank tight.the whole - like the basic idea of like - \\npulling it's faster, but - you could have like that string going around. |||| i think desk toy will be like most  of them, so right now we have two types of desk toys: something that launches and something that's a rocker.i think the launch thing is a desk toy, unless you guys have another idea. |||| that's one idea that we have.what about something else? |||| i like the idea of having a car or some sort of vehicle like a transformer, but still like within the same base.you open it up and it's not that car; it's another car, but when you open the bigger car up the turns into something that the little car uses. |||| that would actually be a cool idea for this one.pretty much like the entire car would actually be modular. |||| i mean you wanna think of something else?i think a modular car is a very, very good idea. |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| i like the idea of like converting bicycles into things, you know?so like existing bicycle parts? |||| well, yeah.hey, you could actually do it - worse idea. |||| i just came up with another idea we could go with.oh, i see what you're saying. |||| i kind of thought - i have an idea what you want to do.some strong concept . |||| or we can all draw a perspective.i'm just saying if we develop this idea properly, what are we doing with that bath toy? |||| partially, but more importantly, you have to get your idea across to someone who's going to be looking at your sheets.it's the concept. |||| depending on what the front wheel was, the idea, it'll like just stay hooked into the boat so the front wheel will stay down and then when we want the thing to come down, this thing will just turn into a rudder so it drives straight.how does it turn into a rudder? |||| no idea is a bad idea.all ideas are good. |||| here, that's an idea.can i have some goddamn candy now? |||| great idea.you don't do the  by this? |||| don't know where i'm goin' with this.this is a bad idea. |||| beat a buddy.steal this idea. |||| i got a jump and go rocket, kinda goin' off the water rocket idea.so it's make a pump? |||| might fall or trip with it.nothing is a silly idea. |||| no idea's a bad idea.i just don't think that would work for a kid toy. |||| let's let that go.i did kinda like my first idea. |||| keep it up, keep it up.one idea, just not this particular project. |||| that's a good idea.then whichever one gets the most votes. |||| i like the idea of making it like a goalie and things are like shooting at the goalie and you have to block as many as possible.but i'm still worried about how do you actually shoot the balls at 'em? |||| you can have one or two guys there, you got the guy in back with the flippers flapping 'em up in front of the goalie.i have no idea how to draw a . |||| all right.so now - \\nwell, so it was your idea, so you can do the sketching, all right? |||| i had no idea to do .this is gonna turn out looking a lot like a star wars guy. |||| i don't think we need to match particularly well, just as long as we have an idea.in fact, i bet if we got a couple different ideas of how we wanted to do this. |||| about the toys idea that you had before, can we elaborate on that maybe?yeah, i just don't see how that's a non-trivial motion. |||| one idea that somebody had that i liked - not that it's something new - is a two player pinball.that was - \\noh, yeah. |||| good idea\\nthat has some sort of mechanical vice on it.like mousetrap or something? |||| how about everybody just do a sketch, an idea?if you could make like a - you know, a crossbow, but then a circular like, inner tube, you know. |||| this is my idea that you have - like this is kinda a takeoff of that quiz thing.you'd have like everybody at the desk would have a like a little catapult or something and there'd be like a bucket for a, b, c, d  put a question above there with the answer and like try to get your answer in the right bucket. |||| and then yeah, by that, you'd have to be able to win somehow.did you have an idea? |||| question torture.somehow combine that with the idea before with the answering quiz. |||| the idea of the journal 0:28:26.1 is that would you shoot your catapult into one of these buckets to answer the question.but if you timed it, like had it using this - see, you didn't actually pull the trigger or whatever, but it was just on a timer so you had to set it to like where you want to aim it. |||| you'd have like a marking to see how high you get up.i was just thinking you could do another idea where you would have like two of these things and you'd have some sort of like call it some piston-type things that you know, you push this one and push it up, you push this one and push it back down and this will be connected to your shooter thing. |||| that's a pretty good looking duck.i was just thinking we could do this idea before, but have like teams, so this person's trying to attack this one. |||| kind of, but without the flippers.the idea is that you'd have - i'm kinda stuck on this quiz thing, but if everybody has like one of these little things that's like a, b, c, so it's like a multiple choice thing and you put your marble in there and fly down this little tube and go to this track. |||| yeah.it's an idea. |||| it's an idea.you could do like the little marble track thing, but at the end, you'd have like some sort of like paper plane so the marble would like fly into the plane and shoot it off. |||| i like the hover toy idea as well.which one was that? \",\" okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. \",\" i was thinking of combining the army men and the chess game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| we could

sides and you're just supposed to make sure that it goes - \\n?yeah, so going back to your idea, the arduino, we could probably have a plane and then you could specify a path and somehow make it follow a path, the plane or whatever it is. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with

game where you could have like magnets just coming out of the bottom that steers around your army men.yeah, like magnetic or something. |||| can we do that?some of these we can combine, too, like the

you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| or its hand, whatever, yeah.we could do it like a two-person game and whichever gorilla knocks over the other gorilla wins. |||| how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| we could have a bathtub game where there's like two ships or something, and then they shoot out balls.because it's kind of restricted, you can play in that area. |||| yeah, like a - \\na football game.football or something? |||| a football player that tackles another football player.you could have a baseball game where one person positions the player and chooses the trajectory the ball will go in. |||| do something that maybe it - like you build it together, like i don't know how you build it, with like different result.i don't know if any of you played, like, there was a game on the computer like, just, when we were probably like ten years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| my first thought, dur, my first thought was to make it a board game, but that kind of already exists with mousetrap, so.oh. |||| i've always wanted a game that worked entirely from magnets.i don't know. |||| for a game - for tailgating?yeah. |||| it's a one-handed game.what do people do now? |||| i mean, what's the point?it's going in my toy - or game, but it -   \\nit's true. |||| they try and pay their students to go.did you guys watch the ball state game against them? |||| i'm trying to think of an outdoor game that's something simple that two or three kids or a group of kids could play.i'm also trying to think of something simple because i'm sitting there thinking - i was thinking of that torpedo and then i was thinking of bouncy balls. |||| let's see.have you guys ever seen that game online where it's like tooting some - and you just kinda like fireworks and drown 42:26.\\nyeah. |||| destroy something and trash .you mean the old dos game? |||| paper boy - best game ever.i don't think i've ever played that one. |||| elephant .what would be a good challenge game? |||| let's see.what's a fun game? |||| that'd completely change the game.oh, but no, it would because you could put 'em in at different locations. |||| boom.we could use this to make the  the whole   board game kinda thing . |||| love that game.is it still popular? |||| name another game, a video game, a toy.you said super smash brothers. |||| you know what'd be cool, but i think it'd be too big and not feasible 01:11:51.\\nwhat?what if you had like a monopoly 01:11:54 game where like - so let's say i have enough to buy - first of all, the pieces would automatically move around the board, so you would roll dice and you press an electronic dice and it calculates and then it moves it for you. |||| how about a jousting game?a jousting toy? |||| what about this 01:14:41 idea?what could we do with a light saber game? |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| there's actually one game that's actually based on  motion.what? |||| something that you can turn into a game, like a single player game.oh, it's 10:10.  i thought it was 9:10.  oh, we have lots of time, then. |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| last year they had that pinball machine.it was a football game. |||| a game like that with a single player that can be converted to a two-player kind of a thing, like two-player games like even battleship.that's a cool game even though it's not so - \\nit's a battleship and a bath toy. |||| you'd have to have kids that are three or under or else it gets weird.but you could have like a division and then you could have your actual game, like something launch something there. |||| and then have the game on it where like you launch your soldiers and then how many of your soldiers of yours reach the other end of the pool wins or something.something like that. |||| now, what your job is - this is a game you play with a couple other people, so player one, you sit there facing side one, side one, and it's gonna require all of these at different times, and your job is to knock 'em down out of the air.it'll all go over and you see how many you can knock down. |||| we're the game - \\njust whack him.make a game out of it. |||| we're gonna play a game today.we need someone to volunteer. |||| they have a game called that: russian roulette.ooh! |||| does our toy actually have to move or do we have to move 0:04:48.7 the toy?well, i mean, can we come up with some sort of like game, like an educational game maybe that requires the toy as part of it? |||| like an arcade game or something?yeah, yeah. |||| that could be fun.like two player games, a board game. |||| what about like a miniature golf game and you have to - like you have a little thing and you have to pull it back and swerve it around to try hit the ball on the green or something.so you like the whole course set up? |||| i mean, we did a lot of modifications yesterday or the other day for a gun.like the quiz game, but you'd have to have some sort of electronic interface for that. |||| if we did a board game maybe and had all the pieces movable, like wind-up pieces.you wouldn't actually have to move your piece. |||| okay.i was thinking of like some sort of board game, kind of like be an interactive board game thing. |||| i was trying to think of different ways you can do that.have you ever seen that game, it's kinda like foosball but you have marbles that like shoot and there's like a - so like here you have marbles and they go down and they just shoot across and then there's like a little trap here. |||| the marbles would be able to get through but the ball isn't.is this an existing game? |||| this is an existing game?i was just trying to think of ways to modify that. |||| we could have like an educational game that like say a - you know one of those old timers with the sound in it.you could the sound or whatever and it would come down and you'd have like a sort of scale thing and once it reached a certain weight, it could then trigger like a catapult and your hand would be there so you'd get hit if you hadn't answered the question in time. |||| i was thinking about how somehow like you could be playing like the fast paced game where once the sand runs out, the board explodes or something, like all the pieces like fly off the board.like a hot potato type of thing. |||| the hand, for something for hand pound pressure.the game? |||| you can have like a two-player game, two icons 0:57:38.8 and it's like one each.i can't draw for shit, so - . \",\" how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| do something that

|||| there's an airplane where as it moves along, the wheels are on hydraulics basically, so it goes, \\\",\\\" and it rides 01:07:54 coming down.okay. |||| it is kinda like a train, too, in the way

be the - \\nhave like two wheels in the back.how do you spell \\\"wind\\\"? |||| really long x.  it was on wheels.it was like electronic. |||| i think it would be a lot easier to do a penguin or do something on wheels, because i would imagine that the swinging gorilla thing would be really technical.probably. |||| something on wheels which moves on magnets, because - \\nwe could have a gorilla on a giant bicycle with magnetic guns on the side.that'd be awesome. |||| i think it's some sort of like queue with some wheels, and then you just kinda like set it, and it like, starts rotating, like around itself, and it just runs off and you have to chase it around.oh yeah, that'd be kinda the same thing as the ball. |||| yeah.having two wheels where you could steer it. |||| but have like, just marbles, and then have a way to set up a course, kinda like a hot wheels, but miniature.for like a marble to roll through, and stuff? |||| you can like, worry about that later.like this sort of - \\nbut you had left the wheels sticking up. |||| oh.no, were the wheels sticking out here, or? |||| if you have a lot of legs it's not hard at all.yeah, to move the easiest is wheels. |||| propelled by a balloon.it can be propelled by a balloon or the balloon could like, push on a wheel, and then spin the wheels. |||| you need to add something.how about gas-powered power wheels? |||| then what about - \\nso if you'd have a balloon on the car, you'd just make that spin like a little turbine that drives the wheels?it's like, it's pretty simple. |||| oh yeah, but eventually we'll have to.i mean, really only what you have to do to - to see - \\nwhat you have to do with that is just make fairly large wheels, and then put a lot of weight in the bottom. |||| 'cause you want it to like, move everywhere, right?could make it four wheels. |||| yeah, but how does that make it random, though?four wheels? |||| yeah.just do like, the three wheels kind of thing, or just have like the four wheels on the sides, and then a middle ball that just moves randomly. |||| yeah?they had like, little like, wheels here that - a wheel in this direction, like this, that would turn the wheel. |||| basically you have two, like this in front of you, like this, two wheels.that's what contacts the ground? |||| looks like the air up the bag or whatever?yeah, just so it just kinda hovers over the - there's wheels, and i just kinda lowered the coefficient of friction. |||| that's what i was gonna go with.you could make  turn the wheels - trying to build a . |||| okay, so for your hand claw idea -   \\nmaybe put wheels on the bottom of it.okay. |||| i don't know.it would just be something that the wheels will actually make the pieces go forward, and then where all the different sections of the snake are connected, with somehow - they'd all articulate so you get that kind of slithering motion. |||| make a snake that slithers across the floor.wheels - kind of connection which lead to - okay, kinda like the ball and . |||| just put a little - you could put -   \\nmr. potato head.- four wheels and a cup holder. |||| -  doing the bottom, wheeling it - yeah.well, if you put wheels on it, then you  wheels on it, then you would have some wheels. |||| it is kinda like a train, too, in the way that the hand - or the cow catcher actually goes.oh, yeah, with the driver on the wheels. |||| and then annotate what - it's not gonna move by the wheels.the driving force is the  cow catcher . |||| yeah, wheels are just there to - i don't even know how to draw a train from the side.what's it look like? |||| i'm not done with my wheels.what time is it? |||| as it goes over the light, the light shuts off.then you could have - so, it's an actual shape with wheels; it's in a maze. |||| there's an airplane where as it moves along, the wheels are on hydraulics basically, so it goes, \\\",\\\" and it rides 01:07:54 coming down.okay. |||| parachutes.what about something like - let's go in the direction of wheels. |||| for what?i think wheels like sliding? |||| sliding?wheels? |||| the wheels would be - it would bend inside when it gets on water.yeah. |||| make the car go side to side and make the wheels - the wheels could turn.yeah. |||| try it again.you could put wheels on top too, so then if it does it'll just roll away. |||| shoes with wheels in the heels.oh, the wheels? |||| there's not much you can do with that other than put wheels on it or springs.springs. |||| it could be a trampoline on wheels.a trampoline on wheels? |||| it has wheels on top and bottom.yeah. |||| i mean, the car would be pretty easy to make, right?all you gotta do is put wheels and springs on it. |||| a hovercraft?where it's got wheels on the bottom and you go kinda, but you can go on the - \\noh, i got it. |||| no, a hovercraft doesn't need wheels.do you know how a  - \\n it is hovercraft. |||| you do realize that if you have four wheels - \\nyeah.- it's not gonna turn. |||| well, what if you had like little turning radius in there?turning radius, you mean - \\nlike a turning - \\nyour wheels turn is what you're . |||| do a two-channel.steering from the fan, but then when it's on ground, steering from the wheels. |||| frequency and - \\nthings of control, so like forward and backward would be one channel cuz it's on the one stick, and left and right would be one channel.maybe the wheels turn with the rudder or the fan. |||| you don't even have to put the wheels on it.you can take the wheels off. |||| could do like .take the wheels off. |||| you just take the wheels off.so it would only be good on the water? |||| like, they're crazy powerful.my neighbor had an fpv that put out 310 kilowatt of back wheels. |||| no, i  - \\nwithout the wheels.i'd just get a steve irwin . |||| it's the same but bigger.without the wheels. |||| it's not gonna move, is it?are you gonna put wheels on the bottom? |||| so i just feel like we're pretty diverse.or they're just trying to - \\nthose are really thick wheels. |||| a mexi car.yeah, like he made - \\n mexicans art kinda like had cars that had wheels that would kinda mount, be on the fenders in the '90s. |||| you call 'em the mexi cars?the utes have the double wheels that like brake outside. |||| why did you draw the other wheels when you're not gonna see them from the body?well no, that's just the front, so you're gonna see that front wheel. |||| they might not do that either, but all i remember is there was just a bunch of cars, like hot wheels.they were always powered. |||| i liked things that were on tracks.everybody had hot wheels on tracks or like you could have a roller coaster that connects. |||| another i guess like base idea that i thought of, is you know like the wheels on a chair, like they spin like this and then they start turning.if you want to spin your chair you start rolling. |||| or do you wanna make it two wheels.so you could put like a recessed wheel - i was thinking for now you could ignore it. |||| it has - everyone has like the same base, the full wheels with a bunch of connectors on it.then you can put your own doors; your own roof; put a cannon mount on top; and whatever you want to make it look however you want. |||| yeah.or like if we did a wind up plane and instead have like the propellers spinning instead of the actual wheels moving. \",\" i think it would be a lot easier to do a penguin or do something on wheels, because i would imagine that the swinging gorilla thing would be really technical.probably. |||| i think it would be a lot easier to do

basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. \",\" do we use these sketches?are we what? |||| do we use these?i don't know. |||| so if we have something like a mop kind of a thing attached to it, it would just be used for cleaning.you could use it to do that, and it'd be cleaning at the same time. |||| it matches this little  cap.people actually use this. |||| i was thinking of combining the army men and the chess game, so you have like a - in the chess idea where you have this app they could play on their tablet and it'll use magnets to move your pieces around.you do the same sort of idea with the army men and the big mat. |||| then if we end up liking that one best, we'll use that one.we've got 40 minutes. |||| is there anything else that we wanna combine with anything else?kinda like this idea, because it's got like a commercial use to it. |||| the to make this age is to like use water.so you can actually see something come out like . |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| pro-e is like, boring.if we could use . |||| yeah, so like basically you use, like you're saying, sorry about the programming, you can use that and just drive all of like two wires to it, just activate the motor and then the rest is just mechanical, so, but like just do, like do what - \\ncan you glue it on first?let's do the head and the arm, and if we want to add the alarm clock, add it later, right? |||| that's actually fine, because like this, we could - like we could use, have this, like as our concept now, and then if we see that it's like way too complicated, we can - \\nyeah.this is kinda fun. |||| could go fine, if it is difficult, you could only use certain dimensions and only got like three features.yeah, so you can do it however you want. |||| should i use this one?i think you can just use what you've got there and outline it. |||| yeah, you could use that, .i'll do what i gotta do. |||| it's like the weird, the awkward size.it's not  enough to like - \\npeople were like, complaining that they wanted like a mini-ipad, like that size, but it's kinda retarded because you like, have a phone that's this, this size, and it's an ipad, like - what in the hell would you use . |||| no, no, no, because like the way samsung, because you know, each phone, like each android, can use like a operating system in a different way.like, htc has a slightly different, like it's just different  and different shortcuts. |||| nice.now use a sharpie. |||| supposed to use fine .what is your guys'? |||| what else do we need?what other kind of motion should we use? |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| but that's - yeah, that's not what we're concerned about.if we use different gear ratios . |||| - we can use the model, i think.yeah. |||| give him a crank - oh, yeah, like a puff air compression?yeah, just get - use a spring that just compresses the air real quick. |||| hm?i really wanna use magnets. |||| this could be a cup holder, and it crawls.but use it when you're eating dinner to pass things to other people across the table. |||| let's design this drastic -   \\nwe can do this.we  fission, but we only use it to do a car. |||| it's got a flatbed, and then it's got the -   \\nokay.yeah, we can't use the - can we use that? |||| that one's pretty damn good.i think you should only use your - my ulterior pen. |||| small like that.just sits on your desk too and use you. |||| well, i mean, if you have - i don't know.if you use something really light, when it - if it cracks open and falls, it might not splatter everywhere. |||| you could have some sort of plastic base that's got a bunch of holes in it that you could make - like you could take pillars and put pillars in the holes.then you could use just loosely interconnecting blocks to make the walls and stuff. |||| we could have something like that.we have a camera in there and you can use facial recognition so it only moves when  - \\nonly moves when no one's looking at it. |||| boom.we could use this to make the  the whole   board game kinda thing . |||| and use that energy.it has suction cups all around the ball. |||| we could also use the same concept where there's chemicals inside.then when you throw it down it performs a reaction - \\nreleases like - \\n - and then it shoots out quickly. |||| aren't we supposed to use sharpies and stuff?i don't know. |||| what would you use as weapons?weapons. |||| every time you wanna do that you gotta use a co2 canister.yeah. |||| didn't he say don't use springs?huh? |||| have a thing that you could do anything you want with it.what can you use besides co2? |||| then your train's done after the first time you use it.yeah. |||| that one-time use toy.mine lasted three times and then that was it. |||| yeah.we could only use cotton balls or rubber bands, tape or straws. |||| we have market value cuz they'd always hafta buy a new train - \\n\\n - cuz their train's gonna be destroyed.it's a one-time use. |||| their train's gonna be destroyed after the first use so - \\nit's a terrible toy.right. |||| that way it will be one-time use.you bought it as special collectable trains, like whatever show's on. |||| you try to use energy so even if this is - cuz this needs to be perfectly efficient for it to actually fly.where with a helicopter you can make it 40 percent efficient, and it'll still somehow flutter. |||| cuz you use that energy from spinning.it would just shoot off, if it flies that is. |||| or you could just take apart a remote controlled car and then use that as the base to build off of.do you know what we do with that actually? |||| doesn't have to be what we use.just an idea. |||| didn't steve irwin use those?yeah, in the swamps and stuff. |||| no idea's a bad idea cuz it's an idea.what if we use something that had some sort of thermal power to it? |||| -  gonna do is gonna get - \\nhuh?the whole reason - the whole point of this class is so that we can actually use the 3d printers with our pro/e models. |||| we have to use the 3d printers?i don't know if that's the rules, but like - \\ni'm assuming cuz everyone does. |||| dummies can't use it.i feel like children would choke on that and die. |||| look at cigarettes.put in super - put in supervision of parents, or use in supervision of adults. |||| we can use magnets.it would just stop rolling. |||| just use one of those bb guns, if the - \\nand spring load it inside.but automatically. |||| where it just like feels like that.we can actually use it - have fun with army men with this, too. |||| i like the idea of the space tank just because i really like space and we can use - we can do a star wars - \\ngod!you and your star wars! |||| yeah.a lot of people just do like - use trip codes  for  or . |||| do you have a pencil sharpener?yeah i do but i'm not gonna let you use it. |||| let's go with one of my ideas.so really, can i use that sharpener? |||| we could make a smaller version.i mean - \\nor we could - yeah, take that and then actually use - yeah, use the design and design our own. |||| he has a sharpener.yeah, he won't let you use it, either, though. |||| so then the one will be like - yeah.i wish i could use a ruler. |||| i don't know what you would do, but - \\nwhat are you thinking now?it's a car that splits and then you use it for some other reason, though. |||| they use gyroscopes in like space applications, essentially because - let's pivot it there and there.so this is the outer, middle and then on the inside, in this middle you have like a spinning, rotating mass or something. |||| keeps pointing the same way.how do we use it in a toy? |||| we could use this maybe in a game, like board game something.idea that it points the same way, although i don't see how, but some way. |||| the thing is it would work in two, because water and oil don't mix, but if you use two polar liquids, they're gonna mix with each other.what's the deal? |||| actually, i thought of something.instead of using two different fluids, we could use two fluids and a solid, cuz then those definitely will not mix. |||| got a little tank thing that rolls and as your front tires spin it loads the barrel, itself.you can use to fire. |||| you're gonna want to use 'em .oh my god. |||| you use like the - you let it go .teach me. |||| we'll use that one in the military.how'd you win the war? |||| you've got like a little flipper here and either the pushbutton is electronic or you could use your own hand and just pull down the little flipper.ball rolls in,

right over your fingers? |||| i can make it go like - i can roll it down my arm and .pretty much like at every angle it looks the same. |||| it looks reflective?it looks reflective. |||| let's start

what? |||| crossbow thing looks mean.so it can be anywhere from like 2, 3 up to 12, 15.  oh yeah. |||| instead of having like a thing 0:56:51.1 there, you have like an actual person or something like

|||| yeah.but then with the projectile, if this has a lot of energy, you can probably make a roller coaster and then make the whole marble go through it, because if it's fast enough through the - then you shoot that extreme 37:18.\\nso it's like a magnetic popgun. |||| we can probably make a big figure and then using the thing you were talking about, the magnetic thing, and they'd have gorilla fights.have gorilla fights? |||| how could we probably make a game out of this?i mean this is a good idea, but i don't see people shooting at each other, because if you just kind of move it, it's gonna be pointless. |||| i mean i guess we could probably just design this and just not even worry about the dart board if it came down to it.yeah. |||| i think it would be a lot easier to do a penguin or do something on wheels, because i would imagine that the swinging gorilla thing would be really technical.probably. |||| do you wanna narrow down on one idea now?i kinda think we probably should get to that. |||| these are the main ideas we've got.probably the gorilla, the gorilla bike. |||| jesse clark did it.so we're saying this one's probably not gonna be it? |||| i think this one's gonna be more practical.i'd probably agree. |||| anybody care to draw a two-point perspective?i suck at it, but i'll probably try. |||| one other thing i always thought would be pretty fun and probably really hard to make, would be something that juggles mechanically.yeah. |||| it can be a fairly simple motion like, you could probably do it with just something spinning in a circle, but you'd have to have a way to catch it, and stuff.put it up there, man. |||| or an octopus, you know how they go like, \\\"fffft.\\\"probably something with candy. |||| do something that maybe it - like you build it together, like i don't know how you build it, with like different result.i don't know if any of you played, like, there was a game on the computer like, just, when we were probably like ten years old, maybe less, and it was like this, like cartoon thing. |||| probably should keep going, so i mean, not that we're getting anywhere.huh? |||| not that we're getting anywhere, but we're probably supposed to keep going.yeah. |||| yeah, yeah, yeah.yeah, but if you like, put it in a, a - \\nnozzle and stuff you probably won't - \\nyou can make it, it'd probably just have to be like a flapper of some sort inside of it. |||| you'd probably have too much resistance.i don't think it would go . |||| 'cause you're gonna find, you can buy those.it's probably, the only problem i see with this is - \\nbalance? |||| yeah, use the contact ground and there's a kind of lever thing with a solenoid - not a solenoid, a servo in the bottom, and basically all the weight's on the bottom, so that's probably same on bottom, and this pops out and it's a  thing in the air.hmm. |||| you could probably make it where it was like a wind up so it rolls a certain distance and then releases and it pops up.we did have that idea. |||| kids.what ages, probably like eight to 12? |||| yeah.probably maybe the front ones, too, to keep it floundering. |||| it's probably .the motor inside's probably . |||| well, i'm sure a small, little tiny one and that wouldn't go - like a bathtub probably wouldn't work.'cause they had - they did it with - the ones they used - the fan boats - then they put a sail on it and they did it with that and they were able to actually move along the lake. |||| yeah.a little submarine probably is pretty trivial motion. |||| there'll probably be rare occasions, though, where the feet moving would combine with the wings and it would fall over.we gotta find . |||| hm.like , i guess, but then you kinda - if it was set on a certain frequency, then it'd probably just cancel it out if it didn't know how - or what position it was in. |||| it'd probably be just like a metal sphere between two magnets and you let it go at one extreme - it might stick to that one, though.if - but if you had - at a certain distance where it wouldn't stick, it would just keep oscillating back and forth for a little while - eventually, this - go to steady state, but for that little while, it'd provide a shaking force. |||| then just weigh it down so it always lands face back up.well, it couldn't be too heavy or else it probably wouldn't flip. |||| you could probably control it using a rudder.it'd be like a . |||| i mean, i guess black powder's a little more -   \\nmm-hmm.probably get a little more power out of that. |||| i wonder if you could get it to rocket up and then have it - sustain it, like - i mean, this is probably getting to be real complicated at that point, but -   \\n  \\nwhat's your major?not . |||| we can't get our own football team on there,

where it - it's the easiest two-point perspective one to draw -   \\n  \\n- probably this one that has all the squares. |||| oh, yeah.i'll put a cup holder on it, but i need to - i probably need to -   \\noh, it - 'cause it's - i like it because it's a trivial motion, 'cause it's only forward, but it's a non-traditional way of getting that. |||| i don't know.it'd probably be . |||| we could probably put some sort of counterweight here at the top of it.oh, yeah, like some of those weights so it pushes the hand down? |||| they're probably not gonna enjoy all this cussing on the .they'll just look at team three and they'll look at their list, and it won't be us 'cause we're not team three. |||| i'll probably screw it up and delete it.put in my train profile. |||| yeah.you probably wanna take thermo two. |||| really?probably wanna do thermo two unless you're going into systems and controls. |||| yeah.which - probably not. |||| probably.everybody has a strong opinion about it 'cause you can't be good at all three, i don't think. |||| hm, probably not.i don't know. |||| i'm not very smart, so i guess i'm probably good at one of them.oh, no. |||| i think we should probably - we're probably - although i think firing something, or opening movement and i think that's all considered nontrivial motion.i wonder what trivial motion is. |||| well, it's something my company did at work, but then it got killed before it ever made it to actual production, so i think it'd still be illegal and copying it, wouldn't it?i mean, if you - if you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement, yeah, probably . |||| i feel like drive by is an inappropriate - for little kids.probably. |||| probably should start.i mean, this gives us 20 minutes to narrow it down, so we wanna come up with more ideas for - \\nwell, we do have to do the final one. |||| if it expands out.weight distribution will probably be a good show. |||| african rumble?probably not. |||| yeah, probably not.you know how

would. |||| my vote - \\ni'm going with this.this is not less hard - it's probably easiest for us to do. |||| it's probably from the shock\\nonce it fills up with a certain force from hitting the ground then - \\nokay.it basically breaks. |||| you think that'd be enough?the good part about this is that you could probably control exactly how it's rolling once it reached that speed versus the

|||| i really wanna meet up sometime and try to figure that out, though, in a room with a white board.i should probably - no. |||| you mean a toy for the outdoors?i mean that's probably a game or something. |||| just push it in?actually, if there's a propeller, then this probably has a crank or a spring loaded. |||| probably not, cuz i don't think we can develop like a computer - \\nwell, i mean if you have the basic parts, then you can.i don't mean like - no software involved. |||| probably better if it doesn't have too many parts, too many small parts.if it was a car we could make something on the scale of like a die cast car. |||| just put in more definition, this ball, this sphere.that's probably another ramp for this thing, the same here. |||| i feel like you could probably - you probably could.i mean if this one was more for like adults, you could go and change parts out, so you could actually have like stronger spring, stronger - so if you actually just want someone -

like eight to 12? |||| make your kids do the housework.next generation of toy is tricking your children into cleaning. |||| i don't know about kids.i . |||| then it's like - it's more of like what?how big of kids are we going for? |||| does it have to be for kids?i think so. |||| big kid toy.we get to describe our own target market - customer, so we could just say -   \\nforget kids. |||| kids.kids. |||| i'm trying to think of an outdoor game that's something simple that two or three kids or a group of kids could play.i'm also trying to think of something simple because i'm sitting there thinking - i was thinking of that torpedo and then i was thinking of bouncy balls. |||| toys.what video games are popular for little kids? |||| for nontrivial motion, you would.what do kids like playing with? |||| i feel like drive by is an inappropriate - for little kids.probably. |||| do little kids like james bond?i don't know if little kids might, but you might - you might get early teens. |||| i mean, you do it in the bathtub with little kids.they're instead of playin' with rubber ducks they have little spinning tops that they could battle each other with. |||| i've seen some little kids still have that.one of the kids - \\nhe just whips it out. |||| i think we need to start training the modern us kids to fight back so we need to give 'em like 20 missiles.actually, i read - i heard an article on  npr that so many children are becoming obese that a quarter of them aren't fit to fight in the army, so it's a national defense issue. |||| although a smaller army would probably be a good thing cuz we are way too bloated in our army.the kids are - \\nthe navy is. |||| yeah, you - lawsuits.stupid kids. |||| they're like - \\nyou can fish with them?- for little kids, yeah. |||| we can get - buy like a marble run thing and just make it.kids, think kids. |||| kids, keep it simple, stupid.that's not what you're doing. |||| well, i don't - could be a bit dangerous for kids, actually.so dog is actually swimming in the water. |||| that could be a bit dangerous, kids having a needle.i think we should pick an idea and start getting it to be - \\nactually, no. |||| i think we should give the kids these toys in china where they're like - they work in factories and make stuff, and that's their toy.you're terrible. |||| let's not just think college, because we might be limiting ourselves.let's think for kids that are 12 and under also, like do something that would be cool - i don't know. |||| the funny thing is like i notice when you become a college student you pretty much like to play with some of these other toys that are meant for kids.legos and stuff? |||| yeah.like college kids love legos. |||| it's some bowl for kids.it's like gyroscopic, so it's always - when you have something in it, it's always . |||| you'd have to have kids that are three or under or else it gets weird.but you could have like a division and then you could have your actual game, like something launch something there. |||| especially if the little kids shake it up.so it's just two layers again? |||| and good for kids cuz it teaches them, you know, like eat fruit.right. |||| okay, just making sure.all like 25 kids in my grade. |||| some more instructions for you to write up what you did.target customer would probably kids like who don't like their fruit, or who really like their fruit, one of the two. |||| and that's gonna keep kids in the bath.listen, it's a win/win situation. \",\" closest or the farthest object?probably the close - welcome - \\nbecause if it goes to the closest object, it's gonna bang into it, right? |||| then there's like planes coming from all sides and you're just supposed to make sure that it goes - \\n?yeah, so going back to your idea, the arduino, we could probably have a plane and then you could specify a path and somehow make it follow a path, the plane or whatever it is. |||| it just goes down and then you pick it up and you put it back up here.like a rube goldberg machine? |||| it goes through?yeah. |||| two people, two kids, and then once the ball's  and the other one, it starts sinking.then the person who loses has the whole thing - kind of goes with that idea. |||| you just move the player so that the ball goes in that direction, and then there'll be the person who's batting who - you know like a super motion, and then shoot.that would be a mechanical motion. |||| you'd have a slower motion.you'd have to time it when the person hits, when the ball comes in, and then it just goes back like this, like that. |||| make a little segway?yeah, a kind of segway type of thing but it's just like , goes everywhere. |||| where it like, when it goes off, it just like jumps off your night stand and just starts like, rolling around so you have to go chase it.that's good. |||| yeah, you have to catch it, like in a pool.oh, that sounds - like, still be rc or - \\nno, it just like, goes like random, like it just - \\nbut it's hard to make something move fast that's underwater. |||| i was thinking like, one of the ideas i had was like a, looked like a swing that you like, like push, every time it goes you have to push, and then like the  you have to loop it by pushing buttons.i don't get it, what do you mean, loop it? |||| would we, i mean, electric just turn it on and it goes?yeah. |||| yeah, for senior design?like, we can - i'm saying like we can do some sort of toy that goes off that kinda like idea. |||| input i guess, yeah.you're gonna do something like that, like the weather's bad, it gets bad and it just goes \\\"fsssssssssss\\\". |||| very, very satisfying in the morning when the alarm goes off.yeah, but, you make it with a catch. |||| yeah, because if you wanna make this rotate, like - \\nyou make it punch like every time you push down, it goes like this.or like this. |||| the only thing is, it's a pulse signal, i'm pretty sure, that goes through a speaker.say like we can just go buy like, those ones that are, there's ones that are like - \\na constant? |||| on the inside.oh, on the other side, or maybe - \\nyou gotta make the arms - \\nit moves like this, choo-choo-choo-choo, and every time the arm goes like this, it - \\nfires the led? |||| yeah, a four-bar linkage, yeah.it just goes, yeah, you'd have a rocker here. |||| mm-hmm.it just goes this much and just with the rotation, it's a constant rotation, and then like have a little, just a little switch that whenever like, this arm goes all the way up front, like makes contact and lights up the led, so it just goes, chh-chh-chh-chh. |||| okay.then we could have kind of two different phases, see how our timing goes. |||| it's like wind's reflecting off, and if someone goes around the sail, it's - all kinds of weird things happen.it's like the magnet on the front of the car. |||| it goes in the water and then half of it's submerged in water, half of it's in air, 'cause air's less dense, so when it comes back around to go - when it comes out to 180 degrees - or 90 degrees to the water, it's not pushing and providing enough force back to cancel out the propelling motion forward, so something similar to that, except you would have to have the medium where those two gases met.if you just had air, it would - when it pushed down to provide up force, when it came back around, it would push up to provide down force, and those two would cancel out, but if it went into a medium of -   \\nwell, if you use a cup or something, you get a different pressure. |||| it's just motor with a weight on it, and we don't care if it goes any direction.it could go any direction. |||| you could have this one that goes under .that's what i was just thinking, dude. |||| it's got a screw in it or something so that when it goes, it'll go over the - it'll periodically just go in front and shut the flow off and redirect the flow.i'll show you what i'm talking about. |||| i was telling my girlfriend about this toys  class, and i was telling her to think of ideas for me, and so she suggested - i don't know if you guys are - how long it's been, if you've seen wall-e.  \\nyeah.you know the little cleaning robot that goes around and scrubs? |||| here's what i'm thinking for the actual mechanism inside that does it, though - so you have a ramp thing, so it goes up and then it, what, forces the claw up, and then it -   \\nthen it drops.- then it pulls back, and then it goes back, then it -   \\ni like that, and you just have a wheel, so it's -   \\nit's just - it's like a wheel. |||| it is kinda like a train, too, in the way that the hand - or the cow catcher actually goes.oh, yeah, with the driver on the wheels. |||| what if you have something that has a little base with a spring coil in it or something and just this little lever, and then a little helicopter top that contains - and i don't know what it would contain, but contains something so when you hit this lever, it's already wound up and it just kinda releases the spring and it just flies up and goes someplace.i think there have been similar things to that. |||| the coin goes, \\\"chuu.\\\"yeah. |||| or the ones that like at a museum 18:22 where the ball goes up and rolls in all these different directions and hit springs and all this other stuff.yeah. |||| ask him.trivial motion would just be like an arm that goes around in circles, but it doesn't do anything. |||| well, first of all, i'm gonna - \\na pac-man toy that drives around; it goes, \\\".\\\"i don't know. |||| as it goes over the light, the light shuts off.then you could have - so, it's an actual shape with wheels; it's in a maze. |||| a wind-up toy where it could pull the cherry out and then it goes up until the cherry gets next to its mouth.nice. |||| like with hungry hungry hippos, it goes out, grabs something, and puts it back and then it rolls to a tray cuz it's stuck on the side.yeah. |||| there's an airplane where as it moves along, the wheels are on hydraulics basically, so it goes, \\\",\\\" and it rides 01:07:54 coming down.okay. |||| that kinda goes along with - \\nthat goes along with - yeah.mars rover? |||| if someone goes for two, four - two and four - this or that.well, that's the four fours together. |||| then it could have some robotic arms that goes out.all right. |||| basically, it just rolls around, and you can control it with a remote control, and it just goes everywhere.does it do anything? |||| it goes everywhere on the walls.yeah. |||| it goes everywhere on the walls.all right. |||| exactly.or it bounces - \\nonce it bounces back up then it does something, and then it goes back to it's regular position - \\na ball. |||| yeah.how would it shoot somethin' out as it bounces and it goes up? |||| they could go like - \\nour toy goes fast on a train.they could go in two directions. |||| maybe mimic a dolphin motion.it jumps out the water, and it goes back in and it jumps out. |||| that would be a crappy toy if you hafta - it goes on for half a second and then you gotta pick it back up.is that like a pinball machine? |||| you could make it like you wind it, and once it goes there's a little thing that comes out and then shoots it off.then you can try to jump over things. |||| when it goes when you shoot it off, right - \\nyeah.- it tilts over or something. |||| have a spring that goes like - and then there's prob'ly somethin' attached that sticks outta the car like this.yeah. |||| you control it and then - \\nhow do you control the where it goes?where it rolls - \\n\\n - around? |||| wanders the block and come back down.i think it's - \\nbounces back there, goes back home. |||| how you make this \\n\\nyeah, we got - you hafta wind i guess something that goes to it.is your spring vertical then? |||| you know what i mean?it goes like - \\nyeah. |||| it's like \\n  that way it actually goes higher than what you toss it at.you know what i mean? |||| well yeah, but it does .it goes on land. |||| the only reason you're doing - you're driving on the left hand is cuz you were colonized by - \\nyour left hand goes forward, back, left, like left and right.your steering wheel has to like stop you crashing so you want control with that one. |||| you have an inlet here where water goes in.water goes out over here. |||| - that's like rocket thing, like man on the space with like a thing inside it and then like this balloon thing you jump off and the rocket goes flying up.okay, i need you to explain that to me slowly. |||| a rocket thing here and it's sitting on a base that's got like - and this rocket thing has like a chute built into it and this is space, there's like another one.then there's a pipe coming over here and then the thing that you jump on and it squeezes the air out of this balloon up here and goes boosh and the rocket goes pshew! |||| well, i mean it's not gonna hit the stars.well, i mean - but really, it goes more than eight feet high, abs would break on hard ground. |||| this is the cone.it goes over. |||| - released?if it goes high enough it should just come out . |||| air goes up, so this is hollow, pushes it up.what if we did some sort of an airplane? |||| no one knows what - \\nwell, because the tail goes - \\nit's only got three second memory.- and it just kinda goes really nowhere, but i still like them. |||| ratank, racecar tank's pretty cool.goes 150 miles an hour, burnouts. |||| that's good.so this one goes into exploding. |||| what if you divert some of the water to the middle of the shower to his body and he's sitting on this axis and the water goes in and you've seen one of those things where every so often if this it fills up too much, it dumps.so like every so often you get the surprise splash of water on your head. |||| i remember the  of one thing.it kinda like - like you toss it up and it kinda like goes up and then like comes back together with the balls that expand and they're like atoms. |||| it's pretty much it's a solid ball when you toss it up and it goes whoop and then you catch it and it goes - yeah.i've seen those. |||| no matter how you put it together it still goes.modular. |||| the inside of the car can be shaped into - \\nwhat about a track in a maze, something like that?like an educational toy that would actually be like a functional car, but the entire internals of the car -  i feel like it would be a little complicated to make, but the entire internal of the car would be like a ball starts here, goes through the engine and actually goes through like the entire fuel system, where the fuel goes from the front to the back. |||| this goes through the middle of this, like this.it's a disk? |||| this button and this thing goes up, takes that .water not included. |||| not the  of it.i guess if the maze is just immersed in water and you blow on it, it goes. |||| that's like a rotational - like if the body's rotating and then it comes - and then this is where all the mass is, so like we could put like something that's aerodynamic here so there's more drag up here, more mass down there so his body extends so that he goes into the water with the heavy side down, you know what i mean?yeah. |||| this could be like, \\\"whee,\\\" in human form that just goes .that's awesome, dude. |||| you make like a circle; it goes this way and a circle that goes this way, something like that.did they say to like do these lines? |||| it's like a ufo that kinda levitates, got a big fan, a big fan right in the center.then it goes out to the four corners, four channels on the bottom so it's stable. |||| if you knock down, say, 15 of 'em, then you get 15 points.you load 'em back up into the other side and player two goes, and then it all lines up and he's just trying to knock as many down as he can. |||| you start out with a base vehicle and you can add your own side plates, your own roof, your whatever you want, weights to it, but you won't - everyone has like a similar tip plunger, at least it's the same length.then it goes - it attaches the same size, so back here everything, you can customize it however you want, but everyone's go the same like jousting rods. |||| and the skid .then the skid goes over and the car's stationary. |||| something like that.the guys back here that's got pushbuttons, and as that goes down, those guys come up. |||| i feel like modifying golf or frisbee -   \\nit's gotta have a non-trivial 0:03:23.0 motion and it's gonna be -  .well, speaking of the ball, we could have a sort of like a wind up ball that's kind of run by random gyroscopic 0:03:52.2 motion or something, that just goes random in different ways. |||| i don't know how you wind it up.then under here it's got like a propeller, somehow it goes around  or something like that. |||| like this thing is like hitting some rails and you can like control how high it is by squeezing this thing and it shoots air out and it goes up.you have like another thing that you pull and it shoots a little ball that goes out and try to get into like your opponents goal.

this was cool. |||| cool. |||| that would be cool to do a throwback to that cuz he's undercover police. |||| that's pretty cool. |||| it would be cool, though, if it was like a horse race where it's not necessarily - \\nyeah, that's true. |||| it would be cool if you could shift the car somehow as it was going or something. |||| yeah, it'd be cool if you just - there was the red - like the lights that when you press a button . |||| i think things that appear to defy gravity are pretty cool. |||| that's really cool. |||| i just kinda swipe my finger and it goes to something else that's cool. |||| how cool is that? |||| that's really cool. |||| i feel like we could do something cool with magnets like that. |||| that'd be cool. |||| yeah, that's really cool actually. |||| that's cool. |||| that's cool. |||| that's cool. |||| no, it would be cool if the louder it gets the higher they get. |||| i think that's pretty cool. |||| really cool looking. |||| you can catch him and you're like,

make the ball car do tricks - like, actual design ways for it to do tricks. |||| i just thought that'd be kinda cool if you could - fan ball. |||| it attaches to a sombrero 01:09:02.\\ni would think that would be cool - octopus beard that you could put on. |||| i mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be something you find really cool or you would wanna play with, but a kid. |||| all right, cool . |||| that'd be cool. |||| i mean, it'd be really cool, but i'd be really surprised if you could power a kid around on a shoe. |||| how freakin' cool is that? |||| the cool thing with us having ball wheels is that we can - if you power all four wheels, which we could do - we should do - i think that's kinda large - is that it would be able to do the sickest tricks. |||| it's cool. |||| that's kind of cool. |||| laser tag would be cool or a dart. |||| it's really cool when it works. |||| laser tag would be cool or a dart. |||| it's really cool when it works. |||| that would be cool. |||| that would be really cool. |||| i mean it would be cool, but - \\nmake it go downstairs for sure. |||| it was kind of cool. |||| cool, mark it down. |||| if there was a remote control, it would be pretty cool. |||| that would be cool. |||| if we got something that actually worked, that would be kind of cool. |||| that would be cool, if you threw it, and like the air made it expand into like a parachute that like safely landed. |||| that would be cool. |||| it would just sort of be cool, i thought. |||| i'm cool with that. |||| those are really cool. |||| that would be cool. |||| i think that looks like a really cool concept, that thing. |||| when it gets up to - it would be super cool if it was like 300 feet like somehow. |||| that would be cool. |||| that's a cool idea. |||| that would be so cool. |||| it's like oh, cool. |||| that would be cool. |||| that would be - i mean it would be kind of cool. |||| it's a cool idea. |||| i thought they were all cool. |||| i think it's still cool. |||| i think it's cool. |||| that one is kind of a cool concept. |||| i think they're all cool concepts. |||| that's cool. |||| that's cool. |||| i think this will be a really cool idea. |||| cool, all right. |||| so like a cool kid's tv show? |||| that's cool. |||| to expand on that, you could have the hero wearing like a cool american flag beret or something. |||| that's pretty cool. |||| what about a cool army guy? |||| it's like it's army guy, but it's cool, because he has a robotic arm. |||| it's to show kids that soldiers with robotic arms are cool. |||| yeah, cool oscar pistorius. |||| it's like, \\\"oh, you made a zombie cool shooter game? |||| this is a cool toy. |||| cuz it looks cool. |||| you need a linkage or some sort of - \\nokay, cool. |||| okay, cool. |||| that would actually be really cool. |||| that'd be cool, but then, how would you direct it? |||| you have options of making translational motion or circular motion, and then you have different things you can plug into it and it'll make different - \\nthat'd be cool. |||| yeah, that'd be cool. |||| or a motion sensor, that'd be cool. |||| that'd be cool, if we did something with that, cuz then, you have your input there. |||| that'd be cool. |||| that'd be cool. |||| i don't know; i think it'd be cool if we climb. |||| that'd be really cool. |||| it'd be crazy, but it'd be cool. |||| oh, that'd be cool. |||| yeah, that'd be really cool. |||| oh, my gosh, yeah, that'd be cool. |||| that'd be cool. |||| yeah, that's cool. |||| that's cool. |||| oh, yeah, that'd be cool. |||| oh, that's cool; like building and stuff? |||| cool. |||| that'd be cool, cuz then you'd build your own, and then, you'd learn, see directly, like, \\\"okay, this is why this one's better,\\\" like the cause and

could put it in the middle. |||| mm-hmm, or what about, like, when parents aren't home or whatever, and you have a play machine or whatever, for dogs. |||| a cat cannot play fetch. |||| it'll have a

on tv. |||| the young kids would play with the others. |||| my younger sister - \\nthey can play during the winter. |||| yeah, they can play anywhere and it's really cool. |||| desert might be a little hard to play with in. |||| it's one of those things you could easily put back in, put the wheels back on, and play again. |||| that was an amazing play. |||| let's play with this pumping

different age group. |||| i did all of ours in solid works - \\nthree different things. |||| it was a lot different than this is. |||| this is different. |||| just take the first thing that comes into your mind and draw it and then make it different. |||| making it different? |||| making it different. |||| then you could have different targets. |||| maybe we can make new ideas by crossing different

\\nchoose a car type. |||| they're different shapes. |||| we're different. |||| there's really not much different between that. |||| see, i go in the red - it's just like the same thing, but different. |||| this is different. |||| they can look different, like these are just different ideas, right? |||| i like how we're parallel drawing 3d and two sides and then end up with three different cars. |||| i mean, we have to come up with a couple different designs, right? |||| different buoyancy. |||| different buoyancy. |||| the one just having different buoyancies in them - \\nthis would be easier than having different buoyancies cuz then you can make all these out of the same material and not have to worry about . |||| then, these strings have to be different lengths so that they stay at different levels, but i think maybe doing - instead of making like something that you fill with water and then making sure that it's . |||| i mean it could just be filled with air and just have different size weights at the base of them. |||| you have to like - you have to put tape on different floors. |||| we want something different. |||| you can do different color electrical tape like bright green, bright pink. |||| you can get different car bodies, right? |||| could we act like different gear ratios to make it for like older people? |||| then, like older, you can set up more of a longer course so in different gear ratios. |||| we should have different color tapes so people can race and cross. |||| if we can get this to work, then we can start inventing different kinds of . |||| it would be like a bit different. |||| not that it moves while it does something, instead, it's like two different toys in one. |||| like literal - like one was like a blaster gun, whatever, where like different things clipped onto it to make it like look cooler, and do more stuff. |||| it's like a more dense plastic, with just like a different shape to it. |||| maybe you can program it somehow to have different things inside of it. |||| i really don't understand what this object - is it like sphere that just comes out into different pieces? |||| you can like customize it with different decals or something or customize it somehow with magnets. |||| you can play in different stages. |||| if you want to do like a different thing, remove the plates, and expose the fans, and turn it on and throw it. |||| we can actually combine this idea with the plane idea to make it do different kinds of movements. |||| if it's not successful, if the user throws it in a different way, it would like either maybe disintegrate midair or deploy a parachute that it just like, i don't know, stops. |||| you can just make it snort different things on the table, and then it's like . |||| do you want me to write like \\\"arms flail,\\\" then we know it's different? |||| so he could jump at different angles. |||| maybe it's a different one. |||| you'd have to use different silly putty, uh huh. |||| you have options of making translational motion or circular motion, and then you have different things you can plug into it and it'll make different - \\nthat'd be cool. |||| maybe, we can figure out how to make different balls. |||| yeah, the balls could be actually different. |||| sort of like the different birds. |||| yeah, cuz then, i mean, they wouldn't know, but it would be different gear ratios to do all that stuff. |||| you could add different ones, too, like you would put it in different positions of the body. |||| what about different motors? |||| it can also have different wheels, maybe like for sand, so you climb up a hill, like a sand hill. |||| it can be different animals. |||| we could do it like a barbie, so you could dress it for different -

- i mean, you can just do wheels and the gear. |||| i feel like they're just two different paths. |||| the only thing with this, i think it'd be really awesome if we had it do different movements for different things, but i just don't know how we would do it internally. |||| okay, so then, would the arms go up, and then would the arms do anything else for different things, i guess, so like if it's first down? |||| i mean, we could figure out different motions and we could figure out the parameters and the rules of how to interact with the toy, like how to interact so it'd be - \\nno, i'm just saying, like for this one, are we not using that anymore then? |||| then all you have to do is change the different mascot and just different logos, and it'll be for every school, all the sports. |||| then you could move him to hammer different ones. |||| yeah, so it would have - i don't even know how many different possible things it could have. |||| two different things? |||| it's a different

thing because i think, out of all our ideas, that's probably gonna be the easiest to make. |||| i was just thinking like if there was some way we could expand on it. |||| i'm thinking there was a thing we used back in high school for like training, where it was like a ball that was irregularly shaped. |||| that's what i was thinking of. |||| that's what i was thinking. |||| i was thinking like in terms of frisbee golf, like what if like you threw it? |||| all right, i'm thinking we pick an idea guys. |||| i'm just thinking. |||| i mean i was thinking either you attach this to this or attach this to this. |||| this thing, i was thinking it would kind of have like a slot in the middle like this. |||| i was thinking more like have these as detachable and attach them directly to the plane body, instead of the wings that you - is that - is this that boomerang? |||| we were kind of thinking - i was thinking of putting some kind of like rocket on the bottom. |||| i was just thinking, in like movies, you could have a finding nemo type person. |||| okay, i'm thinking, it's like rock'em sock'em robots, that you press the buttons? |||| i'm thinking it's just a giant - \\nor you store the stuff in the hat. |||| i'm thinking kind of like this. |||| i was thinking, it's just like monkey - i don't know what a monkey mouth looks like - like a monkey, but then its arms are just limp. |||| that's what i was thinking. |||| it has to big enough to fire peanuts, so i'm thinking like this big? |||| i was thinking, what if we have a passive fish that moves? |||| i'm thinking like ufos. |||| that was what i was thinking too. |||| i want this, i was thinking, more of a physical, so just all mechanical. |||| are we putting realistic - is this when we're actually thinking about how plausible each thing is? |||| i was thinking let's start, like, simple toys, like, say, a toy car. |||| the last time we met, i was thinking of this game. |||| i was thinking we could have a game where there are two teams. |||| i was thinking it was like a game. |||| i'm thinking of something. |||| yeah, maybe you should try thinking of something with fluids. |||| i was thinking we should select the catapult. |||| i was thinking we could select this also. |||| i was thinking we could combine this with some kind of a game, have like a - \\nwe could also make it a wire - \\nalso the catapult, combine all these things. |||| i was thinking of combining some. |||| how about while it spins, you have like - i was thinking like an eye or something, like an led in there, powered by spinning. \",\" well, with the hopping ball, it would be hopping because there's something inside the - is it kinda like a spring that can just shoot that - \\ni was thinking some pneumatic thing or - \\ninside and so when it's on the ground - \\nthere are some really fast motors  push down\\npneumatic, just , like spring board type thing. |||| well, with the hopping ball, it would be hopping because there's

that. \",\" you take a five gallon bottle of water, you put a little bit of gas in there or like a . |||| there's those water cell motors that - put water in and it siphons it out. |||| you told me an idea yesterday, or two days ago, about an elephant that you would squeeze and it would pick up water, and then you would put down a line of powder and then you would squeeze it again and it would suck up the white powder, but really it's red food dye. |||| we could have like a land version and like a water version, a magikarp and like a retarded chicken. |||| cuz then you can have like a water version and a land version. |||| there's this dude and he's got his fishing pole, goes in the water. |||| then, definitely make sure that they like kinda float in the water instead of like sink to the bottom. |||| throw water balloons at people, not barrels. |||| cold shock the water or . |||| next, we're gonna do the throw frozen water bottles into boiling water and hope for the best. |||| you don't want the water bottles to get too warm before it cools down to a certain temperature. |||| i mean since i live across the street you know two blocks away, i can keep them in my freezer until water is boiling cuz you have to boil two gallons . |||| there's this dude and he's got his fishing pole, goes in the water. |||| then, definitely make sure that they like kinda float in the water

have to be different lengths so that they stay at different levels, but i think maybe doing - instead of making like something that you fill with water and then making sure that it's . |||| that's water cycle. |||| water cycle. |||| look at their water cycle. |||| what if there was something that like you know somehow it was like weighted like that, so it like still - like water still flowed through it? |||| it could flow through the water or water would go through it? |||| it would go through the water. |||| then like it would breath water, kind of be like a water breathing type thing, where like water that came in did something. |||| what if you like - what if it - what if you did like complete challenges underwater, like where you had rings under the water? |||| you got like water. |||| you've got rings throughout water. |||| you've got this toy that's like a - some sort of release water. |||| what is water coming into? |||| what can it do, other than just - \\nyou want it to be like submerged in water, like really submerged inside of that 12:50? |||| you could put like a motor over here that pushes the water throughout the body, and propels it somehow. |||| nozzle, it expels the water back out. |||| what about like a water gun with a trigger? |||| do that with the water gun. |||| the problem is like to have that working, we need have like a water body, where you can play it. |||| the water guns. |||| the water gun and the slingshots are pretty much already done. |||| it goes into the water. |||| you could try to - like throw it - \\nyou throw it into the water. |||| the water propels the fan. |||| the motion of the water gives the fan the energy to - \\ni mean we could like include a motor that like propels by itself, other than like depending on the water to propel it. |||| the water would flow in. |||| the water would go on the outside. |||| it would be easier to have the water go on the inside and the fan on the outside. |||| then in here, there is like water can flow in through here. |||| as the water goes through here, it - if there is a way that we can like we can pump it up, before you put it in. |||| then when you throw it into the water, it starts spinning. |||| amaze them with that, so you're going through water, you don't want to it to be like  spin the fan. |||| i mean the only problem is like compressors take a lot of power to compress water. |||| if you get it wrong, it squirts you in the face with water. |||| water. |||| how about like one of those electric trains, but instead of using the electricity to turn the wheels, it just heats up a boiler, just this whole thing is full of water. |||| i feel like an input would be easier, just cuz if it's in water, then you don't have to worry about the motor. |||| it'll just float on the top of the water, and it'll just hop. |||| we would have to figure out, this place, it will be like little flags, and it would just float on water, like on the water tension. |||| then we just fill the entire thing up with water and that'll be the blastoff. |||| you could make it water or steam. |||| you could use like water. |||| yeah, or maybe, another one, maybe, it'll float and walk on water, or a trail. |||| could we do anything with sprinklers or something, with a water supply? |||| some kind of pipe system, and then you have to hit all the targets with water at a certain - but then, you have plugs in the actual system, so depending on how much pressure you have, some won't hit as far as the other ones. |||| yeah, in the water. |||| it's 11:30.\\nwell, i mean, i guess, we already have an expansion, cuz we said, instead of doing a window, we can do water. |||| water would be the expansion. |||| we could make it like a water bug. |||| everyone loves water bugs. |||| i don't know; i'm not - \\n  we invented this penis frog that jumps on the water, and then it shoots its tongue out. |||| if it was in the pool, it wouldn't be on water, it would jump from lily pad to lily pad. |||| it's got a bug zapper on it, and then it goes in the water. |||| frog; water. |||| the purdue guy's a stationary desk toy, and the other one, you leave it in the water. |||| and water tension, like i don't know if it would be underwater and how big, like would it be obnoxious? |||| yeah, i'm trying to make a boat that  a car, that has these kind of fans down there to give it momentum which are kind of perpendicular to the boat when they are in water, and they become tires when they are on land. |||| when they rotate, you can get up momentum in water and they are kind of rotating this way. |||| water guns don't really have complex motion. |||| maybe we can build on that and then - i'm just saying maybe if we build up - maybe you could put water on one side and then one guy tries to shoot. |||| then the guy could use water as a blocker or something. |||| see, i kinda like a little water gun, man. |||| this is a water cycle. |||| a water cycle? |||| yeah, i mean it can go  water cycle and - \\nyou really like that water to ground thing. |||| yeah, so this style, actually it's on the water. |||| it turns into a paddle boat in the water but on land it's a bicycle. |||| you're actually in the water when you're riding it. |||| we can have some kind of a game where you can put water in it and actually have these small boats with catapults. |||| you guys and the water games. |||| parents are gonna love water all over their living room floor. |||| kids, they love water. |||| alright, mine's - i was trying to incorporate the pedal one and the water ideas, and then just like fire kind of. |||| any of the water stuff, kind of. |||| you're gonna use bubbles to fire into a water tank. |||| are you shooting a water stream but you have to pedal it to make it go? |||| yeah, it's like a water stream, like that. |||| okay, like a tug of war with water. |||| why don't we put water tug of war? |||| water tug of war. |||| it's just combining a sleeping bike, like a comfortable bike, some kind of water-riding skills but it's not completely  water. |||| is this n the water? |||| yeah, just in the water, and also on land you can do the same. |||| it doesn't ever pick up because when you're in the water, the bigger the wheel, the water will actually . |||| it's also a contained unit so mom shouldn't be too mad about the water and it gets a kid exercising. |||| water tug of war. |||| there's pedals at the bottom, pedals connected to a water pipe. |||| then it's water inside that tank. |||| - and it's floating in water. |||| yeah, it's floating in water. |||| okay, i thought you were blowing water, as in like it was a stream of water. |||| you could shoot water. |||| you can have catapults over here and you're shooting water stream, correct? |||| then we can shoot ping-pong balls or something and the water stream gets this started or something like that. |||| or we can use the water and we somehow generate a pressure - like with your idea, so shooting water, and then you generate a pressure in the water. |||| it'll throw a big bucket of water on the guy's face. |||| you know what, in this water scene thing, you can have some kind of balls inside it and you have water. |||| because if you have just water, i mean  \\nwell, who's winning is based on where this is. |||| this is just a tank of water, right? |||| yeah, it's just a tank of water kind of facing the - \\nwe kind of recycle out the water? |||| what if we cycle and we cannot hit this stream of water or something? |||| what if  shooting the water - \\nyeah, shooting the water. |||| you're shooting with balls or shooting with water? |||| no, shooting with water. |||| let's  a game where you have this tank of water but it has these kind of channels which go on the periphery of the tank. |||| you want to control the flow, control the paddle according to how you want the water to go. |||| at the opening, the ball just floats up so it floats on the

a game underwater. |||| a torpedo game, like the point, just like pass it to people. |||| like a darts type game or like a - something that reloads automatically for its motion. |||| some kind of - i'm thinking like a long game now. |||| some kind of like cornhole, slash, lever game. |||| like a tailgating game. |||| who would have thought it would be so hard to think of a game like corn hole, a

you catapult the cat. |||| like an outdoor game type thing, where like you throw it, and see where it - \\nsort of like a young kid's game. |||| i could see like that doing something underwater, like

with people. |||| like a catch phrase or a - \\nit's a game where you play with people. |||| what kind of game would you do, where it's like do four times, and see what happens? |||| like a trivia

- \\nwhat if we did like a game? |||| you could make a game out of that. |||| maybe there's a game that - \\nyeah, catapult. |||| the last time we met, i was thinking of this game. |||| the professor was talking about some zombie game that they had and they won some award. |||| i was thinking we could have a game where there are two teams. |||| then maybe we make it a game and we have a basket or some kind of target. |||| i was thinking it was like a game. |||| it's a game. |||| do you know that game? |||| it's like they hit their heads and then they  \\nthat's a really fun game. |||| i love that game. |||| in india, i used to go there, and they used to have these games where you could make your own games at comic con 19:29.  they have those spots where you can make your own comic con

a board game, but what you do is you have these two goals and then these things. |||| this is something like a strategy game. |||| this game is like you're a dj but you're playing memory. |||| we can have some kind of a game where you can put water in it and actually have these small boats with catapults. |||| i really like that game. |||| i think that would be a fun game. |||| i'd say that table game, the one that you have. |||| i was thinking we could combine this with some kind of a game, have like a - \\nwe could also make it a wire - \\nalso the catapult, combine all these things. |||| we have two challenge games, the competition game. |||| 'cause this is not a game night. |||| game is much more interesting. |||| i mean if you want to, at the end, if you want to - \\nthere's more variation in the game so it doesn't get as boring. |||| we have a catapult game now where it's one catapult against another. |||| maybe there'll be a target area around the whole thing and it'll be on a game board that had mountain pieces and stuff that they could hide behind. |||| it's a little bit bigger of a board game too. |||| if we made this an outside game, we could do something where, say, if you dump a blast and actually hit the other person - \\n \\nno, i'm serious. |||| did that flag football game make it? |||| let's  a game where you have this tank of water but it has these kind of channels which go on the periphery of the tank. |||| we can make it a social game. \",\" it's like they hit their heads and then they  \\nthat's a really fun game. |||| if we made this an outside

i'll draw - \\nthe car has one ball at the bottom. |||| okay, so this is a car with two wheels in the front and then the hopping ball in the back, so it's kinda like a castro net 46:49, but then if we

for the jumping - or the flipping car, so this would be the ball and you'd have to have it exposed on both sides for it to go in reverse, but - \\nwhat's that? |||| i kinda like adding the ball to the wheels of a car. |||| it'd be cool if we can figure out a way to make the ball car do tricks - like, actual design ways for it to do tricks. |||| the only thing about the ball car is that - as opposed to the hovercraft . |||| it's like a ball with a wheel inside of it which is attached to the car and just blows it around. |||| your ball is on the ground, the car picks - the vehicle picks it up, puts it in a launcher and then fires it. |||| ball car. |||| we got hopping ball and we got ball car. |||| ball car versus ball. |||| ball car. |||| it's the ball car? |||| what are we gonna do with the ball car? |||| because to turn the ball, you'd have to have one ball turning this way - \\nyeah, the car can't turn  the balls. |||| what if you had a - \\nlooking down the side of the car, it's got features like this on - this is  and then you've got big wheel arches and then you see a little bit of a ball come out. |||| what if it - what if the ball extended outside of the car entirely, but like up, down, front and back? \",\" that goes along with the car and stuff. |||| i was just thinking with things like that, then with our car idea, it can calculate how fast the magnet will go, and

stored. |||| you could use like water. |||| we can use this. |||| you can just use that one and put it on one. |||| or we could put like, instead of lily pads, you could use other stuff, like bugs.

and - \\nwith the pen? |||| they have those old things that they self erect themselves. |||| we can make the bucket big enough where you could put multiple things in there. |||| the things on the

idea, it can calculate how fast the magnet will go, and that's how fast it goes. |||| i don't see you creatively discovering things over there. |||| anyway, back to our important things. |||| i think things that appear to defy gravity are pretty cool. |||| are you thinking of wrist gun or a - \\nthis laser pulses around black dot - or black things? |||| i think the only problem with things like this - \\nyou play cards, . |||| yeah, actually shoots lasers that cut through things. |||| yeah, at 200.\\noh, at work we had one of these laser shaving things and it'd just go . |||| i'd steal one of those things so you could drive  \\nhitatchi makes some huge excavators like the ex8000. |||| let's make giant things for kids, like bulldozer. |||| i used to have those mini rocket engine-type things. |||| they teach you - they tell you what things to buy. |||| i guess - well, that's - well, the point right now is just throw out things. |||| cuz you could do tricks with things like that. |||| well, you're talking about all the rfid things and all that. |||| your ideas are way too similar to things that already exist. |||| i didn't realize there was other things. |||| i watched this one video of this quadcopter that was super accurate and could fly through these little tiny slivers of things and they had spent years on it. |||| how many - \\ndo you guys know how to create the control things? |||| now, the things is - \\na remote control gun. |||| the good thing with things like this is how many of the balls will be powered? |||| should we start sketching some of these things? |||| things that go into it, and then on the bottom of it , you can have like a peg or something coming out the bottom. |||| we need more things. |||| i feel like a lot of people do like cars

kid? |||| it was like glue, those things that's a toy. |||| what about one of those buzz saw things that flies? |||| you know those things that . |||| those things are so bad. |||| speaking of things i always wanted to play with, did you guys ever want to play with a slingshot? |||| sort of, it's like a sphere with these things that poke out of it. |||| like literal - like one was like a blaster gun, whatever, where like different things clipped onto it to make it like look cooler, and do more stuff. |||| the wheels are actually like out here, on these things. |||| what if it was like generally two things connected by - \\nsorry. |||| those things are all like spring loaded. |||| the thing with the long board, like for this class, how big are the things that we make? |||| maybe you can program it somehow to have different things inside of it. |||| if that is like a legitimate - if you have like a reusable like rocket thing, where you can feed it with like baking soda and vinegar esque things. |||| they have those things. |||| like those things - like those little things would fit into it. |||| separate things, both are attached. |||| you've got glider wings that can clip onto it, or like these sort of like rotor things that can clip onto it. |||| these things have blades in it that will spin, and just kind of like float it around. |||| all right, what are the things that i like? |||| wait, it's got legs, and it can snort things through its trunk. |||| you can just make it snort different things on the table, and then it's like . |||| play video games and play outside; those are all the things. |||| dude, these are famous things, i'm telling you. |||| it's just like a whole set of things that can blow each other up. |||| things that they could play with outside; motion. |||| what other things can we do? |||| those ones, when you select some things, and then go forward. |||| what other creepy things could it do? |||| it could say things; it could talk. |||| then it gets a nosebleed when it snorts things? |||| maybe it doesn't snort things. |||| i just don't want to have do things with electronics. |||| i think, you're better than drawing these things than i am. |||| we will work for 15 more minutes, and also, just for the things that we want for your final concept. |||| we have to show you three more things when you're done. |||| no, it's an elephant that does things, but i'm taking the candy. |||| i'm making a list of things. |||| kind of like a videotaper; the little like $200.00 - \\noh, like things that you put on snowboards? |||| put one of these things. |||| you have options of making translational motion or circular motion, and then you have different things you can plug into it and it'll make different - \\nthat'd be cool. |||| those lego mindstorm things; i think that's what we just did. |||| it'll have one of those gear things, those one direction things. |||| maybe little spikes that climb up like this, or magnets that it can climb up a metal wall, so you can replace things. |||| - and it just skims the top and just picks up things its tongue? |||| how would it know to do different things? |||| we could angle the things, and it'll pop forward. |||| the only thing with this, i think it'd be really awesome if we had it do different movements for different things, but i just don't know how we would do it internally. |||| okay, so then, would the arms go up, and then would the arms do anything else for different things, i guess, so like if it's first down? |||| yeah, that way, we can fall back some of these things. |||| all right, so let's just start drawing things. |||| we have to draw multiple things. |||| yeah, so it would have - i don't even know how many different possible things it could have. |||| that's all the things we could do with this. |||| it'll do two things. |||| small things. |||| let's just try and get some things out there real quick. |||| you're havin' big 22s on these things with 48 inch rims - \\n \\nyeah, it's like a monster truck. |||| two different things? |||| i'm gonna try and get away from catapult personally, launching things. |||| basically when you open up this car the body springs out and then his arms are gonna spin 360.  it's just one of those things. |||| do you guys wanna go constructive toys, things you have to put together, or do you wanna go with something with a defined function right on the box? |||| it would be easier for us to define things. |||| there are a few things which has to be - like if you are making something like a boat, it has a swivel 29:32 motor. |||| something has to be the same but you can change the - i don't know if you want to add some kind of wind things and something different, you can add those things. |||| i'm clearly partial to launching things. |||| like you've seen batman or some movies where you've maybe got some kind of  it just kind of retracts some things forward. |||| it's kind of like a board game, but what you do is you have these two goals and then these things. |||| they're like little, i don't know, rubber things. |||| the field is made out of mesh and the goal is basically to maneuver these things around and hit it so that the ball goes in the goal, and so you can defend your own goal. |||| you know the downhill luge things - \\nokay. |||| then it sticks out and it's gonna brush things that'll make noise. |||| you can control the things that stick up to create that noise by pushing a button. |||| salient, i think, means prominent things that stand out on - \\nalright. |||| i was thinking we could combine this with some kind of a game, have like a - \\nwe could also make it a wire - \\nalso the catapult, combine all these things. |||| two more things. |||| which things here are constructed? |||| we need two-point perspective drawings, profile drawings, things like that - so more in-depth drawings, basically, of what we got. |||| do we have to make one drawing or do we have to make five drawings of different things? |||| it's one of those things you could easily put back in, put the wheels back on, and play again. |||| are we supposed to draw the same things?

a ball at it and try to break it. |||| yeah, the little pole and you try to put the ball in the cup. |||| have the ball through the upright. |||| do they have to throw a ball into a hoop? |||| you're launching a ball in that one, right? |||| it's a ball, but we could make it whatever we want. |||| the one below it was a bottle thrower that you throw a ball at in midair and try to break it. |||| just football shaped ball. |||| i think i've seen a basketball one where you push it and the ball - \\nit goes in? |||| you put the ball through the upright kind of a spoon up top. |||| you roll a ball and then once it goes far enough, it explodes and you have a puzzle to put back together. |||| i like this idea where the ball rolls and it explodes. |||| the ball. |||| i like the ball. |||| let's do the ball. |||| have you guys ever run a 3d software where - to help you - have you ever used a space ball? |||| still working on the ball? |||| the ball explodes and you get a candy. |||| two point for the ball. |||| two point for a ball is still a circle. |||| you can't get a ball any other way. |||| it's a ball and plate? |||| yeah, it's an arduino 00:36.  \\nthat's a touch screen and basically he has two servo motors that control, like the ball, touch, it adds weight to it. |||| tryin' to catch the ball. |||| it'd be like a soccer ball. |||| i have this idea where you have a ball. |||| did you hear about the hopping ball? |||| it's a ball that you have a remote control and it will kinda drive it around. |||| just - \\nplates - \\nit's not like a perfect ball. |||| like a soccer ball? |||| like a soccer ball, but the diamonds could pop out and push it down faster . |||| oh, you did the ball as well? |||| what about a ball that shoots claps of air, just - \\nno. |||| i like the hopping ball. |||| the hopping ball. |||| well, with the hopping ball, it would be hopping because there's something inside the - is it kinda like a spring that can just shoot that - \\ni was thinking some pneumatic thing or - \\ninside and so when it's on the ground - \\nthere are some really fast motors  push down\\npneumatic, just , like spring board type thing. |||| let's do hoppin' ball. |||| hoppin' ball. |||| i like the hoppin' ball idea also. |||| if we do hopping ball, we're gonna have like . |||| i was gonna say we can take the bounce, the hopping ball - \\nit'd be hard to keep it from slipping down. |||| i say we take the hopping ball idea and go with the car. |||| how about - \\nno, i'll draw - \\nthe car has one ball at the bottom. |||| i was thinking this thing like a ball. |||| it's gotta have a ball back here. |||| okay, so this is a car with two wheels in the front and then the hopping ball in the back, so it's kinda like a castro net 46:49, but then if we make the car small enough and the wheels big enough, you could have it hop, turn around. |||| it's gonna roll, kinda - \\nthey have a single ball like sam - i don't know if you've ever seen that before. |||| it would be something like this except make the ball bounce. |||| just a robot that balances on a ball. |||| hopping ball. |||| i think the car would be fun; the car with the ball. |||| i like that ball car idea. |||| ball car? |||| you could have one ball in back, two tires on front. |||| now, what i mean - what i'm thinking is - \\nis it gonna be the same as jumping balls or is just gonna be a ball? |||| for the jumping - or the flipping car, so this would be the ball and you'd have to have it exposed on both sides for it to go in reverse, but - \\nwhat's that? |||| i kinda like adding the ball to the wheels of a car. |||| it'd be cool if we can figure out a way to make the ball car do tricks - like, actual design ways for it to do tricks. |||| the only thing about the ball car is that - as opposed to the hovercraft . |||| it's a motorcycle, so you could be driving  - \\nwhat about having a fan inside of a ball that directs air so you'd have air coming in one side and going out another side, but depending on - you could direct the air certain directions so the ball would roll in certain directions because of the way that the fan was angled. |||| i just thought that'd be kinda cool if you could - fan ball. |||| it's like a ball with a wheel inside of it which is attached to the car and just blows it around. |||| your ball is on the ground, the car picks - the vehicle picks it up, puts it in a launcher and then fires it. |||| you could have two guys with cars and a third guy with a hopping ball, and they have to capture the hopping ball and put it in the - \\noh, dude. |||| you pick up the ball, it puts it into a circle - a catch - and then you have - \\n\\nyou have a  underneath the catch, and then you wanna fire, it fires the solenoid that launches the ball and the goal of the whole thing is to get it inside a basket or a goal area. |||| they pick up a ball, they put it on the solenoid. |||| no, i was thinking about whatever we have - \\na ball hop - hopped. |||| are we sold on hopping ball or not? |||| hopping ball. |||| i like hopping ball. |||| i know, but i'm not quite sure - my friend had just a remote control ball . |||| the only idea i have with the hopping ball is the idea of how it's gonna be hopping well. |||| i've seen something where you put your iphone in a ball . |||| the sphero is a robotic ball remotely controlled by an app on the iphone. |||| ball car. |||| we got hopping ball and we got ball car. |||| ball car versus ball. |||| ball car. |||| it's the ball car? |||| what are we gonna do with the ball car? |||| what if it's sort of like using the servo motor for the wheels to turn like this and use the servo motor to move the motor around the ball so it changes direction? |||| yeah, so one for each front wheel and they act independently, so you can rotate  - \\noh, so the ball isn't the primary driving force? |||| if you have the ball and you've got wheels that spin the ball. |||| kind of like in a mouse - the old ball mouses? |||| just one ball. |||| just one ball? |||| if you had one ball, it'd be really hard to drive. |||| because to turn the ball, you'd have to have one ball turning this way - \\nyeah, the car can't turn  the balls. |||| we can have one ball and two wheels. |||| well, the way i was thinking about it is that if you have it this way , so if each of the ball - if the ball has - if each ball has two motors on it - \\nwe have to start sketching. |||| one ball, two ball, three balls, four balls? |||| make it like a 911 with ball wheels. |||| what if you had a - \\nlooking down the side of the car, it's got features like this on - this is  and then you've got big wheel arches and then you see a little bit of a ball come out. |||| what if it - what if the ball extended outside of the car entirely, but like up, down, front and back? |||| the outside of the ball is - \\nis this. |||| you said so the ball sticks out on top? |||| do they have ball wheels? |||| do they have ball wheels? |||| no, but we could totally make that into ball wheels. |||| well, they're supposed to have ball wheels. |||| the wheels turn; both sides of the wheels - both sides of the balls will turn once in a direction - \\nthis is kinda older, but i, robot had that audi and that had ball wheels. |||| it's got ball wheels. |||| the cool thing with us having ball wheels is that we can - if you power all four wheels, which we could do - we should do - i think that's kinda large - is that it would be able to do the sickest tricks. |||| my roommate one year took one of those  things and he had to take like this red ball. |||| then, where he would move the red ball, it had like . |||| like he would move the ball over here and it would follow over there. |||| he would move the red ball . |||| we get to like watch the ball roll down  today. |||| it has like a ball in the center. |||| going off of the spike ball idea, what if you had something with spikes like into it? |||| the frisbee thing and the ball thing, i think would be easy to do. |||| i'm thinking we - if you guys can think of something to do with the ball, the spike ball thing because i think, out of all our ideas, that's probably gonna be the easiest to make. |||| i'm thinking there was a thing we used back in high school for like training, where it was like a ball that was irregularly shaped. |||| it's like a rubber ball. |||| that one, i don't know how you spring load some kind of ball. |||| i don't know how we would manufacture a spring loaded ball. |||| that was supposed to be a ball. |||| a ball flower. |||| yeah, so we'd have maybe a standard ball that just hits it, but maybe one that has like two little tiny balls on the side. |||| they start as a ball, and then when they get close, they battle each other, and then it explodes, because the two magnetic forces - \\ni have no idea what that is. |||| this is like the mine, i guess, and then you have the ball, which is actually a guy, and you roll it over these mines. |||| those would be really hard to do, cuz how would you collect the ball? |||| if they hit button here with ball and - \\nthat's pretty cool. |||| the field is made out of mesh and the goal is basically to maneuver these things around and hit it so that the ball goes in the goal, and so you can defend your own goal. |||| this puff of air comes out on each end and just try to hit the ball. |||| if you want to go right, there's this - if you want to go left you just push on this little ball. |||| you put a ball or something in it and you battle it so you kind of force the ball to go around the channels. |||| at the opening, the ball just floats up so it floats on the water. |||| you see, okay, i've won because the ball's floating on the water. \",\" well, with the hopping ball, it would be hopping because there's something inside the - is it kinda like a spring that can just shoot that - \\ni was thinking some pneumatic thing or - \\ninside and

where you can pitch it to someone, pitch the idea to someone . |||| i have another idea. |||| i like that penguin idea, though, too. |||| that's not a bad idea. |||| get an idea from - let's see. |||| we only need one picture per idea. |||| yeah, that sounds like a good idea. |||| i do like this idea, though. |||| i'm not a harry potter fan, so i have no idea. |||| i do like the idea of something that breaks apart. |||| if you add this idea into this, you can make this longer or stretch it out. |||| which idea? |||| not a bad idea. |||| i like this idea where the ball rolls and it explodes. |||| i love the timer idea. |||| possibly - \\nsame idea, but just different - \\nchoose a car type. |||| we just needed movement, so - \\nthat's a good idea. |||| stick with the light idea first. |||| get the idea. |||| i guess i need idea generation - okay. |||| i was just thinking with things like that, then with our car idea, it can calculate how fast the magnet will go, and that's how fast it goes. |||| it's an idea. |||| tire and stick, i'm not really sure that's an idea. |||| well, the problem is with an idea like this - \\nwe need some more candy so we can actually come up with creative ideas. |||| that's a great idea. |||| oh, some people just like to think through and get the best idea first. |||| we can make - okay, i wanna move on from our idea generation to our car idea. |||| i'm taking their idea. |||| oh, what if you used the mouse trap idea for a trebuchet? |||| i like that idea better. |||| oh, that was a good idea. |||| it's a good idea. |||| that's a horrible idea. |||| i have this idea where you have a ball. |||| that's a good idea. |||| is that your only idea on the board? |||| i like our car idea. |||| i like the hoppin' ball idea also. |||| we didn't even do our race track idea. |||| i say we take the hopping ball idea and go with the car. |||| wait  - that's actually a really good idea. |||| the one , but i still like the idea of a race car. |||| another idea is - a toy that its arm falls off and puke comes out that you could eat. |||| you told me an idea yesterday, or two days ago, about an elephant that you would squeeze and it would pick up water, and then you would put down a line of powder and then you would squeeze it again and it would suck up the white powder, but really it's red food dye. |||| that was his idea generation. |||| i still - i really kinda liked our race car - race track and race car idea. |||| whatever 168 divided by 100  divided by 5.\\ni mean, our car idea would work really well. |||| if our idea for that - \\nokay, we need to select one concept out of all of these - \\nwell, the thing is - \\n- to develop for the last part of the class. |||| which idea are we gonna go with? |||| cuz we need to pick one idea. |||| no, we're not necessarily sold on that idea, but we need to pick one of our better ideas. |||| no, we're not necessarily sold on that idea, but we need to pick one of our better ideas. |||| i like that ball car idea. |||| that's my personal idea. |||| we really should start getting closer to an idea that we like? |||| i like being focused on one idea better than a half ton of ideas. |||| how would they - the only probably is that you'd have to play with multiple people, but if we get your car idea. |||| i like the idea. |||| i'm not trying to down on your idea. |||| the only idea i have with the hopping ball is the idea of how it's gonna be hopping well. |||| now we understand where this idea came from. |||| okay, so with this idea, let's - question. |||| okay, what's the idea - or what's the whole - \\nyeah, i was gonna ask for clarification. |||| that was pretty good \\ni have no idea what i was . |||| yes, just like that, except for real solar - \\ni don't know how we would have - those are outboard wheels and we would have outboard - \\nright, but we could just model it after that sort of general idea. |||| kind of that catapult idea we had earlier, the little basketball doohickey. |||| just the fact that they came up with the idea is the fact that they've made it. |||| that's the idea. |||| that's the idea. |||| well, i mean how we get the fish to float is irrelevant at this point  idea. |||| with the materials we had to straighten the weight idea is probably easiest. |||| i'm liking the car idea. |||| cuz if not, we can always go back to something simpler like the catapult idea like the catapult on the board . |||| i was like, \\\"oh, i had no idea why i started getting this magazine.\\\" |||| put an idea up on the wall. |||| i have no idea how you would do that. |||| you can use it for - i have no idea. |||| i have no idea how this thing is gonna -   \\nthere is also a bunch of candy there, in the brown bag. |||| i like the boomerang morphing into something idea though. |||| that is actually a really good idea. |||| get me a new toy idea, lots of materials. |||| let's try to develop the boomerang idea. |||| i like this idea because this would be really compact and easy to carry and take up less space. |||| going off of the spike ball idea, what if you had something with spikes like into it? |||| that might be a good idea. |||| i like the battling helicopters idea, maybe not with the blades on the bottom though. |||| sort of like the battling helicopter idea. |||| the slingshot - \\nwe can go anywhere with this idea. |||| that would be a good idea. |||| good idea. |||| that's a cool idea. |||| a really good idea. |||| you just have no idea where it's gonna go. |||| i guess an idea of like air causing it to - it wouldn't be like a frisbee. |||| i have no idea how it would happen. |||| all right, i'm thinking we pick an idea guys. |||| it's a cool idea. |||| we can actually combine this idea with the plane idea to make it do different kinds of movements. |||| i sort of like that idea. |||| i'll try to draw like a - \\ni really like this idea. |||| i think this will be a really cool idea. |||| that's a good idea. |||| that's actually a good idea. |||| on the red dot sheets, are we still supposed to use one idea per sheet? |||| yeah, one idea per sheet. |||| one idea, okay. |||| i have no idea. |||| the idea being, select these from the red, then start building these. |||| this should have been a red dot idea. |||| i need an idea to go with that one. |||| i want to run with this clown idea. |||| we should just make this our idea. |||| i think we should just run with the creepy clown idea. |||| i kind of like your elephant in a suit idea; the elephant. |||| i like this idea. |||| our sub-idea is a toy that its arm falls off and goo comes out that you can eat. |||| i have no idea. |||| i like the idea that it has a projectile. |||| i'm pretty sure this is the best idea anyone's ever had for a toy. |||| we only had two people, and ours is probably the best idea in the class. |||| look at that idea generation over there. |||| what about back to your fish idea, or is that step two? |||| is that a stupid idea? |||| they start as a ball, and then when they get close, they battle each other, and then it explodes, because the two magnetic forces - \\ni have no idea what that is. |||| i like the exploding idea. |||| it was your idea. |||| i have no idea how to build it. |||| yeah, with the same basic idea, just like a propeller, and it's gonna be a hood ornament. |||| okay, let's just rule out this idea. |||| we could do that, and then, if we do - so for the purdue guy, if we do the yard thing, i honestly have no idea how hard the coding, like what to do, if we can search google. |||| i like the tinger idea. |||| i like the tinger idea too, just because there is a sound. |||| okay, i mean, we can do - let's just start out so we have it doing the ting idea, for like a touchdown. |||| yeah, or this is a random, well, another idea, but what if we had something so it uses - like this is the dude, and we have almost a drum set. |||| - and trying to - yeah, how close it is to the - \\nlike a battleship idea. |||| alright, so my idea is kinda like a rubber band launcher thing. |||| i'm really stuck on this catapult idea, clearly. |||| i'm trying to get away from something - i'm just stuck in this one product idea. |||| okay, i'm gonna just - \\nhow about this idea of some kind of armor? |||| that's a good idea. |||| here, why don't you write some words down on that though so we get the idea? |||| i was gonna do battle bots but that seems like a  idea. |||| a couple more done and then - \\nalright, one more idea each. |||| for my final idea i have a bike deal. |||| let's pick an idea. |||| we're gonna select a couple, single digit numbers, and develop them, and use the cross-producting idea to see what we come up with. |||| - good idea. |||| that's kind of a good idea. |||| i'll just - \\n\\nwhat i did is kind of combined this idea a little bit with this idea. |||| i like that idea. |||| or we can use the water and we somehow generate a

like choosing ideas or just like, for example, the propeller is one idea. |||| the leds are one idea. |||| going back off the lego idea, starting from the legos, maybe like - \\nwe should add one of those. |||| just fill in the idea. |||| i'm gonna start out with the idea, that thing from like star wars or whatever. \",\" yes, just like that, except for real solar - \\ni don't know how we would

push it. |||| we would just have a coil around the wheels or something, around the axle, and then - \\na coil? |||| like the ones that have the wheels tucked underneath. |||| spinning wheels front and back. |||| turning the wheels is a motion. |||| turning the wheels is a motion and then you have to have a motion for it to do what you want it to do. |||| what you do is you put wheels on it, and then - \\nafter you kill a mouse it takes off to its owner? |||| at least they're all wheels, so all circles. |||| wheels. |||| with a box on top  and wheels. |||| it's gotta have wheels. |||| i saw this one kinda thing where it's like, instead of a segway with two wheels - \\nit's got two wheels? |||| okay, so this is a car with two wheels in the front and then the hopping ball in the back, so it's kinda like a castro net 46:49, but then if we make the car small enough and the wheels big enough, you could have it hop, turn around. |||| what if we have a motorcycle with two hopping balls for wheels? |||| a motorcycle has two wheels. |||| i mean, i know there was a concept design on the motorcycle there where instead of having two wheels, it technically has four, but the wheels are like that large and are next to each other, so it still looks like two wheels. |||| what if you had the car with all the wheels are balls, so they could rotate in any direction and you could just spin the car in place? |||| even if they have wheels, they still suck. |||| i kinda like adding the ball to the wheels of a car. |||| i like the car with balls for wheels, whether it's that one or the one you did. |||| i'm thinking like one sphere in the back and two wheels in the front, but - \\nis that what you're thinking? |||| i really just locked wheels. |||| what if it's sort of like using the servo motor for the wheels to turn like this and use the servo motor to move the motor around the ball so it changes direction? |||| if you have the ball and you've got wheels that spin the ball. |||| only the two wheels inside are actually motors instead of sensors. |||| cuz i said three wheels and motors. |||| we need to come up with how many wheels and how many balls we want on the car. |||| we can have one ball and two wheels. |||| or we could have two wheels - two balls, two wheels . |||| make it like a 911 with ball wheels. |||| i mean, you see the wheels on cars though, so i don't know if that'd work. |||| do they have ball wheels? |||| do they have ball wheels? |||| no, but we could totally make that into ball wheels. |||| well, they're supposed to have ball wheels. |||| what if we had inside the wheels they each had their own generators that could just make light, so they just light up wheels that - \\nlike leds? |||| it's just a - the wheels are touching the top. |||| yes, just like that, except for real solar - \\ni don't know how we would have - those are outboard wheels and we would have outboard - \\nright, but we could just model it after that sort of general idea. |||| because what i see you can do is you put one motor with a - and then belts to outer wheels and those are top of the balls. |||| the wheels turn; both sides of the wheels - both sides of the balls will turn once in a direction - \\nthis is kinda older, but i, robot had that audi and that had ball wheels. |||| it's got ball wheels. |||| the cool thing with us having ball wheels is that we can - if you power all four wheels, which we could do - we should do - i think that's kinda large - is that it would be able to do the sickest tricks. |||| are they gonna be like wheels and it's kind of like - \\ncan we make it a biplane? |||| then, it will make something move like the - \\nmoves on wheels. |||| you can put the hoops on wheels. |||| then, it will make something move like the - \\nmoves on wheels. |||| you can put the hoops on wheels. |||| seriously, if you have wheels, you can like pop the wheels off and have like treads on them. |||| they have to be big enough wheels. |||| then, your wheels are just kind of like that, right? |||| when you swap out your wheels, your bigger wheels are like that and the treads are like that, right? |||| instead of like monster truck wheels, you got treads. |||| you can swap out the body and you can swap out the wheels. |||| you can like race your friends, and they got bigger wheels. |||| monster truck wheels. |||| the back , the brackets across the front, and got wheels, right? |||| you have your rear motor which then has wheels, right? |||| the table's on wheels. |||| it's just like won't you lock them stupid wheels 01:17:54.\\ni don't know. |||| we can have - \\n\\nwheels, so that it can like go as it flaps wings, something like that. |||| then it can like land, just like rollover on wheels, something like that. |||| no matter what it does, it always lands on wheels. |||| wheels come out. |||| something along those lines, where like as the wheels turn, something happens. |||| as the wheels turn, it generates electricity. |||| the wheels are actually like out here, on these things. |||| you've got the wheels here. |||| wheels were coming out of the boomerang or something. |||| it's like the wheels would somehow like fold under. |||| the wheels would come out of the thing. |||| all right, what about, it's a stealth bomber, but there's like motorcycle wheels underneath. |||| how about like one of those electric trains, but instead of using the electricity to turn the wheels, it just heats up a boiler, just this whole thing is full of water. |||| i played with hot wheels a lot. |||| yeah, so you can have bigger wheels; smaller wheels; gears. |||| it's just two wheels, and it has an adjustable length, and it can climb up stairs. |||| it can also have different wheels, maybe like for sand, so you climb up a hill, like a sand hill. |||| i mean, different parts for people, but if it's gonna explode at any time, then it'd be hard to - i mean, you can just do wheels and the gear. |||| when they go on the land, you just start - \\nthey're just metal wheels. |||| yeah, just metal wheels. |||| it's longer, you sit between the wheels and you lean forward while you're riding it. |||| essentially when this target was hit, the opposing catapult's projectile, the piece here will disconnect so the top will basically fall down and the wheels will fall off. |||| it's one of those things you could

i've seen a basketball one where you push it and the ball - \\nit goes in? |||| that goes along with the car and stuff. |||| if you do it faster, then the siren goes on. |||| you roll a ball and then once it goes far enough, it explodes and you have a puzzle to put back together. |||| or make it like kitt and it goes back and forth. |||| the light goes back and forth. |||| it self-corrects it so it always goes back to the center, which i thought was pretty sick. |||| i was just thinking with things like that, then with our car idea, it can calculate how fast the magnet will go, and that's how fast it goes. |||| it goes and then - \\nit just goes. |||| i just kinda swipe my finger and it goes to something else that's cool. |||| cuz it goes - watch, he'll put his hand down. |||| it doesn't go that far, but it goes whoop. |||| then it has a little thing inside and it goes, \\\"rrrr,\\\" and then it spits up red blood everywhere. |||| you can have like  that goes in it like is anchored to the bottom. |||| when he paddles, it just goes in a big circle. |||| there's this dude and he's got his fishing pole, goes in the water. |||| it goes up and just starts . |||| there's this dude and he's got his fishing pole, goes in the water. |||| it goes up and just starts . |||| it's surprising how much shit goes into that. |||| if we make something like  that flaps wings and goes around. |||| then it goes up or like - \\nit's like you throw it like - yeah. |||| then it goes like up here. |||| that air coming in this way and swishing it upward, that it goes upwards, something like that. |||| then it goes back down to the ground. |||| you like time how long it takes, like how high it goes. |||| something like that goes like that. |||| it goes into the - no. |||| it goes somewhere else. |||| it goes into the water. |||| goes through that hoop, or just - \\nyeah. |||| as the water goes through here, it - if there is a way that we can like we can pump it up, before you put it in. |||| fly it through wherever it goes. |||| yeah, as it like goes up here. |||| or something - we can make it something random, that if either like they put the parachute, or it just goes into a motion like this, that this is like a successful motion. |||| then just goes. |||| for the morphing thing, are you suggesting if we throw it, and it goes up to a certain point, and just like elevates, or it just like - \\nno. |||| it goes straight, whereas, a driver goes far. |||| when you throw it, it just like takes off and goes up, and has like an altitude sensor there. |||| then you have to put it back together, but it actually goes far. |||| all right, that goes with the amputee soldier guy, and that goes with the  guy. |||| this little pin goes here. |||| all it just says, is randomly, it just goes, \\\"hello?\\\" |||| wait, you mean he goes like this? |||| yeah, he just goes like this, and the faster he spins his arms, the faster those goes. |||| the elephant goes there. |||| okay, so my cousin loves slime and all that stuff, so we did something and, i don't know, it's like a snail that, as it goes, you have the trail of slime or something. |||| then we just make the - \\nwe could use a stepper, so then you could control how far it goes. |||| or wireless, so it goes into here. |||| when a rocket goes off, it discards - is the fuel? |||| it kind of goes back to, maybe, there's a box and you can explode it, and then you can put more of them together. |||| there's an axle that goes through everything and there's a fan. |||| we could make a toy that goes down the stairs or something. |||| i don't know, something just stupid that - \\nthere's that stupid bird that dips his nose and goes out. |||| maybe, i'm totally getting this wrong, but it's like a stadium, and then it goes over. |||| then, once it goes over these mines, then it explodes into a little man or something,  a fat man, cuz then you have the magnetic field or something. |||| i mean, if you're at work for like six hours and he's just sleeping and wants to get petted, he just goes in this thing. |||| it goes into its stomach. |||| it's got a bug zapper on it, and then it goes in the water. |||| it goes like a pool cleaner, except in the shape of a frog. |||| if they did a field goal, it would be him kicking, and then, if something bad happens, the head goes down. |||| what if one goes over the couch? |||| i don't know how, like if you got a touchdown, it would be six points, but then, how do we make it, when he moves over and gets a field goal, and he hits again, but now it only goes up by one point. |||| yeah, exactly, but the goal is now to see how far it goes. |||| this leg hits this leg, so this leg goes forward, and this is over here, this leg - so it's like two leg motions at once and the robo is balanced completely. |||| i'm sure it still goes on but it's not on tv. |||| the field is made out of mesh and the goal is basically to maneuver these things around and hit it so that the ball goes in the goal, and so you can defend your own goal. |||| you pour a beer in there, it makes it jump down in here, goes in the three pubs, then you chug instantaneously, and then that's the garbage you puke in. |||| it kind of goes with him being launched out. |||| this goes up and down. \",\" i mean we can have - well, it's probably a spring, right? |||| i mean we can have - well, it's probably a spring, right? \",\" probably cuz it's class, just jack one out of an existing thing. |||| probably wondering what that is. |||| the sheets that are marked with the blue dots, if you followed the instructions, you probably got the inspiration from selected ideas. |||| you really want to - \\nwe probably could. |||| probably. |||| it's probably cuz we're in this room in the middle of the building. |||| if we do that, we would incorporate probably some type of target or something in it. |||| this is probably not a good toy. |||| that one's probably better, actually. |||| i know, but once we start the project, you're gonna get them all mixed up probably. |||| if you follow the instructions, you probably got  selected ideas. |||| i gotta see how it's dude 01:00:44, but those would be tiny gears and you'd probably strip 'em before anything else happens. |||| yeah, it's probably gonna be that. |||| how would they - the only probably is that you'd have to play with multiple people, but if we get your car idea. |||| i was thinking - so, there's probably something out there kinda like it, but you just have a car - \\noh, like if you put a cow catch on the front and you were playing soccer with it. |||| you have an opening on the inside that kinda puts it into a - some sort of probably - \\nyou could take it to the next level. |||| we should probably decide on something quickly. |||| probably not. |||| probably not. |||| i should probably - sorry, i'm gonna use your blue pen. |||| with the materials we had to straighten the weight idea is probably easiest. |||| probably gets better signal than mine does. |||| with all the programming, we have to - \\nwe probably will. |||| yeah, if you have like a dirt path, you could probably just like tape it. |||| probably. |||| it's probably faster just to start writing stuff, as opposed to trying to sketch everything. |||| let's probably take down the airplane transformer. |||| like probably 8 to 12.\\nprobably more like a 12 year-old. |||| i'm thinking we - if you guys can think of something to do with the ball, the spike ball thing because i think, out of all our ideas, that's probably gonna be the easiest to make. |||| it would be print 01:16:33.\\nprobably not. |||| not for this class probably. |||| i think in terms of feasibility, probably like the spinning helicopter is gonna be the easiest to make. |||| probably. |||| the sheets that are marked with the blue dot, if you followed the instructions, you probably got inspiration from some selected ideas. |||| i think those notes are probably sufficient. |||| probably not. |||| yeah, probably. |||| i feel like it would have to be a lot, really fast, which would probably, in turn, make it really dangerous. |||| probably. |||| we only had two people, and ours is probably the best idea in the class. |||| they already make something, probably, that you could buy that already incorporates it into it, that you can just integrate it. |||| i mean, that'd be hard, because of the force or whatever, you'd have to figure out that friction and everything, but then, we could probably do a solar panel or something on that, so it would move when the sun's up. |||| we'd go in and fill up balloons, and then, we'd sit in the back and suck out the air, and probably killed a lot of brain cells. |||| well, it's probably been five minutes. |||| probably not a pancake, cuz that's kind of heavy, and how would you know when it's done, unless it was automatically timed? |||| the baby kangaroo would probably be stronger than the big kangaroo though, just cuz of like - \\nyeah. |||| we probably could do this, but it wouldn't have to explode. |||| i mean, we probably could figure it out. |||| i guess other people would probably put their hand above. |||| the sheets that belong to the blue dot, if you followed the instructions, you probably got inspiration from some selected ideas, so if you have such groups, mark them together as a group with the same number or the same letter, exactly. |||| probably a lot. |||| i don't know, probably. |||| i mean we can have - well, it's probably a spring, right? |||| there probably is one. |||| probably for an older target market or a mother who wants to kill her child. |||| you can probably tell. |||| probably gets a better signal than mine does. |||| yeah, it's probably gonna be something competitive. |||| it would probably be something you played on the floor. \",\" teach your kids music. |||| you demographic to a bunch of little kids. |||| those are dangerous if you have an adult who pushes the kids cuz an adult remembers, i wish i could go faster when i was a kid. |||| he does it and the kids are hanging off and going sideways. |||| that's safe for kids to use. |||| yeah, that's great for kids. |||| that's great for kids. |||| toys these days are so much cooler than when we were kids. |||| kids love 'em. |||| yeah, kids love guns, man. |||| i think kids love beer. |||| drinking game set for kids. |||| let's make giant things for kids, like bulldozer. |||| what else can we do that kids would like wanna ? |||| that's too violent for our kids. |||| what if we had a toy that teaches kids that guns are bad or violence is bad? |||| kids love violence. |||| - on kids for the motion. |||| yeah cuz shocking little kids. |||| taser for kids. |||| something tells me little kids. |||| you know i think they were saying that it's like  college kids and not a - yeah, it's just a - oh, there's a behind the back 30-yard touchdown pass. |||| would it be safe for kids to play with this thing? |||| i mean it could be for little kids. |||| what do kids like these days? |||| what do kids like to do? |||| i mean, try to take something that kids hate and make it fun. |||| what about a do-it-yourself, like a wind farm for kids? |||| what about something bigger that kids could play with outside? |||| oh, you could have one - \\ndo kids still eat pez these days? |||| it's to show kids that soldiers with robotic arms are cool. |||| actually, robotic kids will give them powers, cuz they're kids. |||| it just scares kids; scary toys. |||| really weird kids. |||| \\\"we brought in a bunch of kids to play with your toys, and you scared them. |||| you made kids cry, congratulations.\\\" |||| have fun, kids. |||| kids? |||| the kids would have to make their own pulley system or gear train or gear drive, so then that would be what would move their monster or whatever they make? |||| okay, so what other types of toys do kids like today? |||| i mean, i feel like this is more for younger kids, maybe, and this is more for like - \\nadults? |||| then you could go on the bottom and you could - they're all built out of this really - it's not styrofoam but it's lightweight foam so kids would be down on the bottom picking up planes and trying another one. |||| kids like to dress up like some super heroes, but this is like a transformer where you get these weapons out in some kind of a different motion. |||| okay, so we're killing kids. |||| younger kids won't  \\ntwo person, and it can be activated by one person  \\nyeah, yeah. |||| the young kids would play with the others. |||| kids, they love water. |||| parents don't like kids playing with toys when they take a bath.
