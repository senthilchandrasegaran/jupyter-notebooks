    "## Inferences ##\n",
    "There are overall more words spoken during the divergent process (average per team of 7245 for the Free Group) than during the convergent process (average: 3272 for the Free Group). It is thus not surprising to see a difference in the number of words with information content > 12. Note that this value of \"12\" is just an attempt to split the word list into three sections based on a visual inspection of words ordered by information content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This difference, however, does not exist for the D-C group (average per team of 5243 words for both divergent processes combined, and average of 5321 for both convergent processes combined). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Divergent Process ###\n",
    "We looked at the words **_common_** to both groups to see the similarities between the groups. While a closer examination of the common words and where they occur in the text is needed, currently we can see that the number of these common words, and the number of co-occurrences of pairs of these words is similar across the two groups (columns 2 and 3 in the \"Divergent Process\" table. A similar result can be seen in the communities as well. Looking at the words **_unique_** to these communities also reveals a more  or less similar result; there is not much of a difference, at first glance, between the two groups when analyzing their divergent processes. An early interpretation of the results anticipated two possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More communities with fewer words/community:** These could denote a greater \"breadth\" of idea genration (generating more ideas that are unrelated to each other). This should be the case for the Free brainstorming group.\n",
    "2. **Fewer communities with more words/community:** These could denote a greater \"depth\" of ideas, i.e. a greater exploration of each idea. This should be the case for the D-C brainstorming group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that neither of this is apparent. Perhaps we may see a greater separation if we were to not exclude words with information content < 12? This may be worth running an overnight analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergent Process ###\n",
    "Again, there is not much of a difference in the co-occurrences of words common in both groups (aided by the fact that _very few_ of the words are common). we can see that the number of words unique to the convergent process is higher for the D-C group, since the teams spent more time evaluating and refining ideas in the D-C group. The number of communities in the D-C brainstorming group is also higher. Though it appears to be the opposite of our expectations (that the D-C group will have fewer, but larger communities), this may well be because of the time spent in evaluating ideas. Again, a more comprehensive analysis using _all_ words is needed.\n"
