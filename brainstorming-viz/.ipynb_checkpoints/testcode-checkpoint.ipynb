thing—\\r\\nWhat if you had a Nerf ball sort of gun, where you can—there’s like a little catcher on the top of the gun for catching the ball and an arm that feeds into the gun.', 'You shoot.', 'It’s

on how many we end up with, and then see which one we like best.', 'Yeah.', 'Can we do that?', 'Some of these we can combine, too, like the army man game and the chess game or like the—\\r\\nHow about like 9:25 we switch to seeing if we can combine things, and then like ten till or something we figure out which one we want to go with?', 'That way we’re on a little bit of a time clock.', 'Yeah.',

candy wraps here.', 'We could have it so that it could come down and hit it, hit like some kind of rubber pad, like a trampoline-type thing.', 'You wouldn’t have to make it stay on the track all the time that way.', 'Yeah.', 'What’s a marble run?', 'I’m not quite sure.', 'You know what a roller coaster is, right?', 'Yeah.', 'It’s a roller coaster, except for with marbles.', 'You put the marble on top.', 'It just goes down and then you pick it up and you put it back up here.', 'Like a Rube Goldberg machine?', 'It goes through?', 'Yeah.', 'The one I had when I was a kid came with parts.', 'You get to make your own track.', 'Yeah.', 'I had a couple of them like that.', 'We could do underwater fish.', 'Fish that had a certain amount of points.', 'We could do like a crab at the bottom of the bowl, so we wouldn’t have to worry about points or anything.', 'Just make it heavy enough to sink, and then make it walk on the bottom or something.', 'Okay.', '.', 'There’s a walking crab that’s in the display case.', 'There is?', 'Yeah, so it would be kind of making it to similar to something that’s already been done in class.', 'We can make anything that just sits close to the bottom.', 'We could combine that giant bicycle with something that’s close to the bottom, sit it in the water.', 'That’d be cool.', 'A bicycling scuba diver.', 'When I was a kid—what did you play with when you were a kid?', 'I used to play with G.I.', 'Joes a lot.', 'I had at least ten different clothes, like master ones.', 'Then I used to call my friends over, and we used to form teams and just like role-playing kind of a thing.', 'I had this one cracked-looking thing which had a space where you feed circles like this, these small disks.', 'Then you push it from the back and it would just fire.',

electronic.', 'He like churn out 31:24 .', 'We could do a Lego theme dinosaur that shoots disks.', 'Shoots them from its mouth?', 'Awesome.', 'Can we do that?', 'Or a dragon that spits out fire.', 'So a fire disk?', 'I was thinking with actual fire.', 'This is my last candy.', 'I like that idea.', 'Maybe he could throw it to another dragon and he could catch it.', 'Something magnetic.', 'I like magnets a lot.', 'You do?', 'Yeah.', 'I was thinking the chess game; the army men would be magnetic.', 'You move them around with magnets on the bottom, or—let’s think here.', 'Did you ever take like fridge magnets, like throw ‘em, see if you can get it to stick on the fridge?', 'Did you ever do that?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'We can make a game out of that.', 'You just—big fat magnets.', 'They’re really less powerful.', 'They’re just magnets, like disk things, and you try to throw them.', 'Throw them?', 'See if they stick.', 'How are we gonna make that one ?', 'Yeah.', 'Good point.', 'That’s gonna be a challenge.', 'Maybe we could make a catapult and catapult them onto the refrigerator.', 'We could do that.', 'We could .', 'You know those—what are they called?', 'Those projectile guns where you have like a big magnetic ball?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'They have like—I think the way it works is they have like this barrel sort of thing.', 'You have a really weak magnet here.', 'Two really weak magnets here, touching here.', 'Then you have a really strong magnet here.', 'Then you push this strong magnet towards this one.', 'As it gets really close, it speeds up and bangs against this one and shoots this one out really far.', 'Shoots the magnet far?', 'Yeah.', 'It shoots this ball right here.', 'It’s kind of like the—\\r\\nOh, so it’s like the projectile.', 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', 'Except this one is a really strong magnet, when it hits it, it shoots that one out really far.', 'It’s like a pinball machine.', 'Yeah, yeah.', 'Now what exactly does this one do?', 'Like a—I can’t remember what they’re called, but they’re a type of projectile guns where you have a ball here, or maybe just a piece of metal.', 'There’s like a strong weak magnet between this piece of metal and this ball right here.', 'Then this is a really strong magnet, and you push this really strong magnet up against here and it will eventually get pulled in and it’ll hit this and it shoots this weak magnet really far.', 'From this, we can make this thing with the marble run, like a roller coaster, so that the marble can flow through the whole thing.', 'I think this is only downward motion, right?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Yeah.', 'But then with the projectile, if this has a lot of energy, you can probably make a roller coaster and then make the whole marble go through it, because if it’s fast enough through the—then you shoot that extreme 37:18.', 'So it’s like a magnetic popgun.', 'Magnetic what?', 'Popgun.', 'Kind of.', 'Instead of a popgun, you just pull a trigger.', 'It matches this little  cap.', 'People actually use this.', 'I can’t remember what they’re called, but it’s like a type of projectile gun, really high-powered gun.', 'Except the thing is, the stronger you make this magnet, the harder it is to separate it from here to here, so to reload it you have to really crank it up.', 'Do you want to start writing something?', 'Let’s come up with one or two more.', 'Just a suggestion: don’t get stuck up in trivialities.', 'Even the nontrivial motion, you can relax it, bring it back later.', 'Just come up with more creative ideas.', 'That’s more important.', 'Later on .', 'Something like a candy dispenser.', 'Gumball thing?', 'No.', 'Candy dispenser with a projectile so you can just sit on your bed and it throws the candy at you.', 'Like a catapult?', 'Yeah.', 'We can  a catapult I mean

men.', 'Instead of a chess board, you have a big mat.', 'But the only thing about that idea is I don’t like the app idea.', 'I don’t think we’d be able to do it.', 'Yeah, exactly.', 'That’s right.',

gorilla fights?', 'How about a gorilla that moves like that?', 'Would it shoot marbles out of its mouth or something?', 'Or its hand, whatever, yeah.', 'We could do it like a two-person game and

do.', 'It’s just enough ridiculousness that it might just work.', 'Yeah.', 'I like that, too.', 'Shouldn’t be too hard.', 'You could do the  bicycle.', 'Would we make it magnetic or remote controlled
